<p>'It is not a cost-free phenomenon. It poses public health policy challenges and social challenges.</p>
<p>'The underlying cause must be the "pornification" of the culture and the increasing sexualisation of pre-adolescent girls.</p>
<p>'Too many young girls are absorbing from the popular culture around them that they only have value as sex objects. Inevitably they act this notion out.</p>
<p>'Government needs to respond to spiralling under-age sex, not with pointless schemes to teach abstinence, but with better PSHE (personal, social, health and economic) teaching in schools for both girls and boys.'</p>
<p>Rebecca Findlay, spokesperson for the sexual health charity FPA said the research highlighted the urgent need for statutory sex education in schools.</p>
<p>She said of the report: 'Society has changed dramatically in the last fifty years and the nature of relationships has too.</p>
<p>'Education and information safeguard the sexual health needs of young people and help them resist having sex before they’re ready, which is why, given this data from the NHS Information Centre, there’s an overwhelming need for statutory sex and relationships education in schools.'</p>
<p>However, she added: 'This tends to reflect other research on the issue, but we must remember that most young people under 16 aren’t sexually active.'</p>
<p>Public health minister Anne Milton said: 'Young people should think carefully before having sex - it's not something to rush into.</p>
<p>'Consider seriously if it's right for you, what contraception to use and the best way to protect yourself from sexually transmitted infections.'</p>
<p>"...im a young female that enjoys sleeping around and its not affecting me or anyone else, so i think the people bad mouthing teens for doing what comes naturally need to back off ! - don't hate the playa, hate the game!, uk"</p>
<p>Fine. Have your so called "fun". But just wait until you are older. Trust me, there is a high probability you'll revise your thoughts and have regrets. I know so many women in this position.</p>
<p>"If the men have 9.3 partners who are they sleeping with if the women only sleep with 4.7?? - Anon, UK,"------------->>> I wish someone would explain the maths involved in this. To me it's a bit like Eve having had just one partner, but Adam having two. - John C, Rotherham S.Yorks"</p>
<p>Around 80% of women sleep around with only 20% of men (the alpha males).</p>
<p>"never experienced the female orgasm then???how sad..... - don't hate the playa, hate the game!, uk"
Orgasm or not, my point still stands. To a nightclub thug type you are no more than a "hole". Need to sleep around to be happy? How sad..
and to me a nightclub thug type is no more than a s**g! im a young female that enjoys sleeping around and its not affecting me or anyone else, so i think the people bad mouthing teens for doing what comes naturally need to back off !</p>
<p>What's the point of the legal age being 16 when you are being taught at school that it's ok as long as you practice safe sex. Nothing about love, respect, serious relationships or more importantly abstinence! Oh and something needs to be done about BOYS, too! Girls can't be the only ones responsible for resisting pressure you know.</p>
<p>If everyone waited until mariage before having sex a LOT of problems with our society would be eliminated. Sex is not just about having a good time--it is far more valuable than that. It is a gift for marriage between two people for the purpose of procreation. It is now demeaned, cheapened and trashed and look what kind of country we have as a result. In fact, have a look at the left column on this page and you see what kind of country we have.</p>
<p>Too many UK girls and women are fine with becoming little more than a notch on some thugs bedpost and nothing more than a "hole" to be used to get his rocks off on. Well done feminism and "liberation".
