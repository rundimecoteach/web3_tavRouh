<p>The divide-and-conquer strategy has long proven to be highly successful in getting Ottawa past sensitive issues with the provinces.</p>
<p>So why is anyone surprised that Prime Minister Stephen Harper would use it to blow his way through the political minefield of a new health-care funding deal? Regional economic disparities, provinces that chafe under the yoke of federal control often attached to funding deals and mixed reviews of constitutionally dictated, similar-levels-of-service principles have been fertile ground when it comes to brewing discontent among the provinces.</p>
<p>Throw any federal program on the table and one can be certain the chances of unanimous support among the provinces will be slim. Youth crime, child care, employment insurance — take your pick.</p>
<p>The motherlode of all issues has remained health care, decade after decade, election after election — at least until last month. The provinces were girding for battle at a federal-provincial meeting, held in December to discuss a new funding plan, when Finance Minister Jim Flaherty tossed the pigskin on the field, then left the stadium.</p>
<p>The new deal — not that there was any negotiating — is basically a no-strings funding arrangement that will honour Harper’s commitment to increase health transfers by six per cent until 2016. After that, increases will be linked to inflation and gross domestic product.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia Premier Darrell Dexter, among the half of Canadian premiers who are unhappy with Flaherty’s approach, is headed west this weekend for a premiers meeting where the federal position on health care will dominate the agenda.</p>
<p>Dexter, representing a small province that has the oldest population in the country, is correct to complain that funding based primarily on a per-capita formula will make it impossible for Nova Scotia to offer service levels that will be enjoyed in richer provinces.</p>
<p>The economies of scale that come from a larger population won’t exist and the needs of our aging population combined with high rates of disease incidence are already placing heavy burdens on the provincial system.</p>
<p>Provinces that will be hurt by the new federal approach are banding together in an effort to force Flaherty to reconsider the December package. Led informally by Ontario’s Dalton McGuinty, the group of mostly eastern provinces are pushing the commitment in the Constitution to relatively equal service levels and the principles of the Canada Health Act:universality and publicly funded care.</p>
<p>Sustainability has repeatedly reared its head in federal-provincial health-care discussions. Ottawa has in previous agreements tied funding to contentious issues such as wait times as a means to press provinces to change the way they deliver care.</p>
<p>As for serious structural change, it has been hard to come by. Complaints remain that there is too much administration, too much kowtowing to the demands of a labour- and physician-controlled systems that have been slow to evolve.</p>
<p>The federal position represents a hands-in-the-air withdrawal that will leave provinces to sort out their priorities, with little likelihood of a unified front. Indeed, the Harper Conservatives are counting on this.</p>
<p>Dexter is fighting the good fight on the formula question but there is restructuring work to be done.</p>
<p>Simply cutting funding to numerous health authorities, even as costs for labour contracts continue to climb, specialist-driven care continues to dominate and wait times issues are massaged into submission, is not the only answer.</p>
<p>The restructuring of the emergency medicine system with a so-called collaborative care approach was a major first step for which the Dexter government must be congratulated. But it can’t stop there. Proactive health care that shifts the focus to a patient-centred approach long before expensive, ongoing specialist care is needed must be the new model.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t help for folks who are already sick. Falling down on frontline care for those who need the system now, and who will need it in the decade ahead, will be unacceptable to most Canadians.</p>
<p>Dropping the ball and shifting the focus to squabbling provinces may seem like a fine political strategy for the still-new Conservative majority right now. But they should proceed with caution and listen to provincial concerns about equitable care.</p>
<p>That’s because health care, as previous federal governments have often learned the hard way, is an issue that can come back to bite when political leaders least expect it.</p>

<p>15 Yrs ago, it was discovered one day I had two huge masses in my abdomen. The next morning I was at the specialist's office and two weeks later had surgery for early stage ovarian cancer. Thank God they moved quickly and I am here today to tell you about it!</p>
<p>Five years ago on January 7th, I had a heart attack. I arrive at the QEII on a Tuesday evening via ambulance. The stretchers were lined up and down a hallway with foks waiting who had arrived the same mode of transportation. We had to wait our turn, but I must say, once it was determined for sure I had the heart attack, once on the cardiac floor, I received wonderful care...</p>
<p>That was a Tuesday night. On Thursday they put three stents in my heart, told me I would be in for the weekend. On Friday at 5:00 PM, they came and said out you go. I had to call my husband to come and get me. I might ad, I was not even allowed out of bed to go to the bathroom by myself at that point and still hooked up to the monitors and such!</p>
<p>A couple years later I ended up going by ambulance from work with chest pain. A dye test was done on my heart. The resident started working on me before the cardiologist arrived in the Cath Lab. He punctured through my femeral artery in my groin and conjoined into a regular vein which caused what is called a bruits. After an emergency ultra sound, I was sent home the same day.</p>
<p>Well as time went on, I could feel this lump getting larger in my leg and a flutter along with it. I ended up in the hospital about six or 7 months later. They kept me for six days on the general medicine floor. They gave me a handful of booklets, one that was all about CHECK YOUR MEDICATION BEFORE YOU TAKE IT. I got my evening meds, I checked and WOW...they had given me 125mg of metoprolol (a beta blocker for the heart) and I was to receive only 25mg. I questioned the nurse and she tried to tell me that was what I was to take. I questioned further and she went and got my file...it was then that she saw it was to be only 25mg. Thank God I knew what meds I was taking because if I had taken that high a dose of metoprolol, I would not be here to today. My heart would have stopped.</p>
<p>The treatment and care on that floor was deplorable. The room was dirty with fur balls under the beds. The elerly lady in the bed next to me had arrived with severe chest pain upon any type of exertion. Every time she got up to go to the washroom, she had to ring for a nurse, receive nitrogen and oxygen. When she finally went for her dye test, after two days of waiting, she was 100% blocked!! I shudder to think what could have happened to her up walking around.</p>
<p>Finally, on my sixth day in, a resident vascular doctor came to see me, very young, introduced himself as Matt. He listened to the thumping in my leg, told me I was fine and sent me home. Thank goodness I had asked earlier in the week to see a senior Vascular Specialist. I was booked for the day after they sent me home.</p>
<p>He said it needed to be fixed as soon as possible. I had a pseudo- aneurysm caused from the puncture during the previous dye test. It was growing larger by the day. You could feel it in my upper thigh it was getting that big! Within two weeks, I was in for surgery. Even while awaiting the date, I ended up at the Cobequid because it was getting bigger by the day and I could feel the fluttering in my leg regularly. The arterial pressure was going into a regular vein and caused it to blow up like a balloon. It could have burst!!</p>
<p>After that surgery, I was in hospital for four days. I had asked that no hands-on residents be involved in my surgery, look but don't touch. Well, whenever I asked the resident that was caring for me daily any questions, he was very sarcastic and would answer no questions. The nurses were run off their feet. They have men in rooms with women...</p>
<p>Fast forward to May 2012. My mother was taken to the Dartmouth General by ambulance with a very large, incarcerated hernia, on early Monday evening. She did not get to see a surgeon until after 4:00 PM on Tuesday afternoon. The surgeon said she required surgery ASAP and that they did not have any beds there, he would have to call the QEII. She was transferred there via ambulance and went into surgery around 8:45 PM Tuesday night.</p>
<p>We never got to talk to a Dr, other than a different resident each morning who did not know anything, until Saturday. We were shocked to find out they had also done a biopsy of her liver and abdominal wall and were awaiting the test results!! In the mean time, my mother's health was deteriorating and we kept asking questions, no body would tell us anything. I had Enduring Power of Attorney because my mother was deaf, and could get no dialogue going about her condition. Eight days after being admitted, she passed away. Sad...very sad indeed.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine what we will end up with as a health care system that is so deeply flawed now. Its a circus, sad to say.</p>
<p>....we let this go too long...I'm a health professional....the approach to care is just not health care, it's crisis management. We ignore the role of public health....90% of health care costs arise from 3 maladies.....heart disease, cancer, and diabetes...and the cost average of $6000.00 per Canadian/per annum....is not a good measurement, as many have been no cost whatsoever to the system....the massive costs come from multiple problems....18% of health care costs come from drugs....
....there are many simple things that require only legislation to provide informastion to individuals , but we avoid them...either from special interest pressures or political expediency. Example...Science will tel you that people should be made aware of the caloric intake / sat fats ..of fast foods at point of purchase...this is a must...but the industry fights it...people fight it...</p>
<p>Further to my comment above...the health care system must stop kowtowing to the big drug companies just to receive research dollars...drugs go on the market that have not been adequately tested and cause more problems and side affects than they help.</p>
<p>In my case, I was only 35 when I had my ovaries removed for cancer. I was then prescribed estrogen to take "TO PREVENT HEART DISEASE AND OSTEOPOROSIS." Well, 10 years later I had the heart attack (no family history) and I have osteopenia (precurser to osteoporosous.) I even took calcium and vitamin D supplements. I did not fit the profile for someone prone to a heart attack other than being a woman.</p>
<p>Right upon release from hospital, I read an article that seemed to find a co-relation to estrogen and heart attacks in woman or not doing what they suspected it would in the prevention of heart disease...hmmm. I could go on with some other medication that I was prescrbed that caused great problems and no warnings on the labels at that time. Now, 12 or so years later, there are lots of warnings...many of the symptoms I was having but the medical profession were denying it was being caused by this medication, which, by the way, I had great difficulty stopping the medication and could receive no help even from the Wyeth-Ayerst, the drug company.</p>
<p>We are being used as guinea pigs without even knowing it. I know research is a necessity, but at the risk of lives!!!! And...added pressure on the health care system at the basic level of acute care. There is no doubt in my mind that estrogen was an atagonist in my heart disease. Ten years later they change their tune while I trustingly accepted that I "NEEDED" this med to prevent the heart disease I now have at such a young age.</p>
<p>We need to start doing our own research and ask questions before we just start swallowing what they tell us...and I don't just mean medication, but include the BS, too.</p>
<p>It seems Stephen Harper's earlier view on health care is going to resurface incrementally. Harper is not supportive of universality of programs provided by the government. His implementation of a daycare program is what we have today. His libertarian beliefs are extreme and Canadians are going to experience them with his policies. Even our military has been transformed from a world accepted peacekeeping role to that of providing backup to US corporate imperialism. His earlier views about Canada are not what he considers worthwhile as a second-rate socialist country and he has embarked on transforming Canadian society and its values to his liking. His idea of health care was manifested earlier in his career when he headed the National Citizens Coalition and went to court over universality of health care. He hasn't changed. His first incremental shot was delivered by his finance minister. If no national accord is reached, that will be his first incremental shot at more privatizing of health care. Provincial bickering and the natural disparity among provinces will contribute to Harper's plans to dismantle the social programs and force provinces to arrange their own programs compatible with their fiscal ability. It makes no matter that health care doesn't fit the market model. Harper has a majority and he will implement his style of health care that will include more privatization for profit regardless of what Canadians want or need. Don't be surprised when your wallet will have to be opened more often to provide for essential services.</p>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't we already have a funding mechanism in place to assure government delivery standards from coast to coast? The massive equalization payments that the Fed's make to our province and others are supposed to smooth the inequities. I think our gov't and the 5 others opposed are merely complaining about the fact that they and they alone, will have to make tough choices, without being able to cast the federal government in the role of Bogeyman ( or Bogeyperson I should say )</p>
<p>The bottom line is that until we allow private facilities for our health care, we are merely tinkering around the edges, while the system slowly implodes
In 2010 The OECD said Canadians need to clamp down on their health spending, and they should do so by A) making patients carry some of the costs and B) by fostering more competition.
Competition, meaning allowing private facilities, and private insurers, and, I would say, let the patients using those facilities, or insurers, pay their own costs, and negotiate the charges.
Carrying some costs in the public system means co-pay for all uses of public facilities, i.e. $25 per doctor visit, and a yearly fee for entry into the system. The public system will still tend to bulge with administration and overhead costs. But at least we would have options.</p>
<p>I'm an older woman (69) in pretty good health who lives in rural Nova Scotia. I can drive my friends and older friens to medical and other appointments. My kids and their kids and grand-kids live in many other provinces. We want to be sure that our Canadian health care covers our needs but also the needs of our kids and grand-kids.
Here's hoping Darrell Dexter and other premiers will keep up the fight to ensure that Harper's government doesn't destroy the universality of medicare.</p>
