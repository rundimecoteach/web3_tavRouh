<p>Gut hormone 'could cure obesity crisis by suppressing appetite'</p>
<p>Hungry? Professor Raj Padwal from the University of Alberta said overweight people should still make lifestyle changes, despite the advent of new fat-busting drugs</p>
<p>An appetite-suppressing gut hormone could help obese patients to both shed weight and lower their blood pressure.</p>
<p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone that is secreted from the intestine when we eat. It was recently introduced as a treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes because of its ability to regulate blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Scientists from the University of Copenhagen set out to determine if it could also be used to treat obesity, after noticing it suppressed food intake as well.</p>
<p>They analysed the results of 25 randomised controlled trials involving over 6,000 patients.</p>
<p>They
found that patients who received clinically relevant doses of the
hormone for at least 20 weeks lost at least 7lbs - which was a greater
weight-loss than the control groups.</p>
<p>The benefit was seen for patients with and without type 2 diabetes, but was more pronounced in patients without diabetes.</p>
<p>More...</p>
<p>Common side effects included nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, but did not seem to affect the number of patients dropping out of the trials, suggesting that overall patient satisfaction with the treatment is relatively high.</p>
<p>Dr David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said the hormone had the potential for revolutionising treatment.</p>
<p>He told the Daily Express: 'I am using them on my patients and
have had a lot of Â­success. For some they have been dramatically
successful, with one losing about four stone and having blood sugar
under control for the first time ever.'</p>
<p>The authors said their analysis, published in the British Medical Journal, provided convincing evidence that the hormone had 'clinically relevant beneficial effects on body weight' in obese patients.</p>
<p>They called for further studies specifically on the treatment of obese patients without diabetes.</p>
<p>However, Professor Raj Padwal from the University of Alberta argued in an accompanying editorial that the 'modification of diet and lifestyle remains the cornerstone of the treatment of type 2 diabetes.'</p>
<p>He added that the safety of the hormone is still unknown and close surveillance of its use in trials should continue.</p>

<p>What is it with these people ? Obesity isn't a disease. It is caused by people being greedy and lazy. PERIOD Try eating less and exercising more. It works wonders and is totally free and has no side effects.</p>
<p>With any other addiction you can go cold turkey. People who are binge eaters are always going to struggle because you need to eat for survival so you can't leave your temptation alone. You don't just have to eat junkfood to get fat and most overweight people are not stupid about nutrition. Would you be telling a heroin addict to use willpower? For most people with the media's twisted view of how we should look, weight is a difficult issue.</p>
<p>Even if you ignore the side effects, it doesn't seem to be worth taking the hormone due to the very long time it would take to lose the weight. Weight loss is available in many forms, I'm a Cambridge Weight Plan consultant so see many overweight people. I have helped many people who have lost 2 to 14 stones plus. The main problem they, and I find is that it is difficult to keep off. They have now found that we have diminished levels of hormones, leptin and grehlin, that make us permanently hungry because our bodies behave like its underweight although we are not. This is still the case after 5 YEARS! If leptin and grehlin could be given to these now thin people they would not put weight back on. In the meanwhile, I get all my Losers to hit the Gym, initially to tone, secondly to increase metabolism through building muscle, as it's muscle that burns calories. For the normal people, Its not rocket science, calories in + calories burned etc. see you in the gym and don't leave it too long.</p>
<p>There is natural appetite suppressant available for FREE every day, it's called FAT. A high fat low carb diet keeps appetite under control. It will also cure diabetes 2 without need for drugs with unpleasant side effects.</p>
<p>But for the FEW with severe medical reasons, eating less, cooking at home, managing your portion size and cutting out excessive booze and fast food could cure the obesity crisis too and no nasty side effects or huge costs to anyone else.
But that would be too simple and what excuse would all the 'I'm just big boned' or 'I can't help it' (rare that's ever really the case but my support to the ones who really do suffer) people do?</p>
