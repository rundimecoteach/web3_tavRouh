<p>"My analysis suggests that the most significant cause of office boredom is an undemanding workload, so managers should look at ways of reducing sources of workplace boredom and encourage better ways of coping."</p>
<p>"This could involve enrichment programmes such as job rotation, multi-skilling and empowerment. Encouraging healthier ways of coping with boredom could include education or providing healthy snacks and drinks in canteens."</p>
<p>If you're always bored at work, it's worth bearing in mind the words of the late Steve Jobs, who said in 2005: "You've got to find what you love...your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do."</p>

Keep a pair of light weights in your desk drawer for some impromptu exercise. Try a few biceps curls while you're on the phone or strap on some ankle weights and do 10 squats when you're on your own.</p></p>

Studies show that long periods of sitting down can increase the risk of serious diseases by 40%. Make sure you get up and do some exercises - situps, pressups or jumping jacks - to get your circulation moving again.</p></p>

Using your computer can lead to RSI or back pain if you're not vigilant. Make sure you stretch out your hands and arms regularly. Ask if your office can host a weekly yoga class for a complete body stretch out.</p></p>

When you want to talk to someone in your office, consider if you could go and talk to them in person. This gets you out of your chair and is more friendly than sending an email. It's even more effective if they don't work on the same floor as you do and you have to take the stairs.</p></p>
<p><p>
Avoid your office lift and take the stairs. If your meeting room or canteen is on the top floor, you'll tone your legs and burn calories running up and down the stairs instead of standing still in a cramped lift.</p></p>
<p><p>
Put something you regularly use - a mobile phone or stapler - a few feet from your desk, so you have to get up to use it. While you're standing, do a few lunges to strengthen your thighs and bum.</p></p>

Next time you feel you've been sitting still for too long, put on your headphones and move around to your favourite high energy song. Pump your arms, swing your head, jiggle about in your seat and loosen up - it all counts!</p></p>
<p><p>
Strap on a pedometer and set a target for the number of steps you need to take while in the office. Offer to make the coffee, organise the stationary cupboard and be the office busybody - it all helps keep you fitter than sitting like a stone at your desk.</p></p>
<p><p>
The way you get to work can have a real impact on your general fitness levels. Try cycling rather than using your car or public transport, or get off the bus early and walk for 20 minutes before you get to your desk.</p></p>
