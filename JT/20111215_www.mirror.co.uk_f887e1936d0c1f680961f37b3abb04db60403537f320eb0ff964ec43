<p>After drumming up support online, Mrs Jones-Hughes encouraged other women to brave the cold to feed their babies as part of the flashmob at the Clock Tower.</p>
<p>The customer services manager, who also has a three-year-old daughter Lexie, said she hoped the event would give confidence to mothers who are nervous about breastfeeding in public.</p>
<p>She said: "I've had comments from all over the country about how great it is to make a stand.</p>
<p>"I've got two daughters who may have children themselves one day. If they choose to breastfeed in the future I'd never want anyone to make them feel how I felt."</p>
<p>Local NCT committee member Suzanne Borrell said: "There is an assumption that Brighton is generally seen as a very tolerant, broad-minded community but as this and previous unpleasant episodes show, nowhere is safe from such bigotry."</p>
<p>Faruk Bulut, the owner of the cafe in Brighton's Kensington Gardens, said he supported the right of mothers to breastfeed their children where they want.</p>
<p>He added: "The restaurant was very busy when the incident happened so I wasn't aware of it until afterwards.</p>
<p>"We support the idea that mothers should feel free to feed their babies and we never make it difficult for them. In fact, the cafe is very popular with mothers."</p>
