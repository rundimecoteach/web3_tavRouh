<p>One in four office workers is 'chronically bored', putting their health at risk</p>
<p>One in four office workers complain of 'chronic boredom', turning to coffee and chocolate to lighten up their day.</p>
<p>People are also more likely to have an alcoholic drink at the end of a boring day at work, a study of office-based employees showed.</p>
<p>Four out of five of those surveyed by occupational psychologist Sandi Mann said boredom caused them to lose concentration, and half believed it led to mistakes.</p>
<p>Bored in the office? Research says workers often seek comfort in food, coffee and alcohol</p>
<p>Around half said being bored at work might lead them to look for a new job.</p>
<p>Dr Mann, of the University of Central Lancashire, said: 'My analysis suggests that the most significant cause of office boredom is an undemanding workload, so managers should look at ways of reducing sources of workplace boredom and encourage better ways of coping.</p>
<p>We are all designed to have a little stress in our lives ( not too much however). It's not only in the workplace that this can happen , many people go down hill after retirement , and turn to comfort eating or alcohol. If you are in this situation find new hobbies and exersise your brain too.</p>
<p>I am now on the sick with work related stress and anxiety, suffering panic attacks driving to work etc. I am not a workshy person, but one of those who thrive on 'positive stress and pressure' and strive to do my best, but am restricted by new work procedures which have been established by persons who do not understand how action in one area of work reflects on other areas!!
------------------
I was exactly the same 15 years ago. I left in the end and temped until something else came up. That job was definitely not good for my health. I too had panic attacks on way to work. I used to think, 'if the lights stay green I'll go in. If they turn red I'll go home'. Seems mad now but I was so unhappy. Used to spend Sunday's counting hours til Monday morning.</p>
<p>Too right! Being bored, undervalued, management not wanting you to use your experience of over 25yrs , etc changed my job from being so so rewarding and interesting where one could immerse oneself, into a job that is so boring and totally unrewarding. My job has actually not changed, but procedures within the work area have drastically altered, and not for the better for our customers. A positive workplace can put external problems out of your mind for some of the say. A negative workplace makes external problems grow. This has happened with me. After over 25 yrs of employment, I am now on the sick with work related stress and anxiety, suffering panic attacks driving to work etc. I am not a workshy person, but one of those who thrive on 'positive stress and pressure' and strive to do my best, but am restricted by new work procedures which have been established by persons who do not understand how action in one area of work reflects on other areas!!</p>
