<p>AGE OF WOMEN WHO HAD SEX BEFORE 16</p>
<p>16-24 - 27%</p>
<p>25-34 - 18%</p>
<p>35-44 - 14%</p>
<p>45-54 - 10%</p>

<p>"These findings will be of interest to the NHS in tacking matters such as sexually-transmitted diseases and contraceptive services."</p>
<p>Rebecca Findlay, a spokeswoman for the sexual health charity FPA (Family Planning Association), said: "This tends to reflect other research on the issue, but we must remember that most young people under 16 aren't sexually active.</p>
<p>"Society has changed dramatically in the last 50 years and the nature of relationships has too.</p>
<p>"Education and information safeguards the sexual health needs of young people and helps them resist having sex before they're ready which is why, given this data from the NHS Information Centre, there's an overwhelming need for statutory sex and relationships education in schools."</p>
<p>The survey also found that 68% of men were overweight or obese. Twenty-six per cent were obese, up from 13% in 1993, when the survey was first carried out. Fifty-eight per cent of women were overweight, with 26% of those obese - up from 16% in 1993.</p>
