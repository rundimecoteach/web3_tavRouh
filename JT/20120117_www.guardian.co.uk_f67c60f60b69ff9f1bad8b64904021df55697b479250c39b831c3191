<p>I don't suppose I'm in the target group for Yves Saint Laurent's new skin cream Forever Youth Liberator – but what if I did want to know whether it's worth shelling out 60 quid for a 50ml tub? I could be wowed by the (strangely similar) media reports. "It is likely to be one of the most sought after face creams ever," says the Telegraph. "5,000 women have already pre-ordered a face cream using ingredients which scientists claimed would change the world." Or as the Daily Mail puts it, the cream is "hailed as the 'holy grail' of anti-ageing". (You have to read on to discover that it's Amandine Ohayon, general manager of Yves Saint Laurent, who is doing the hailing here.)</p>
<p>But I'm hard to please. I want to know about the science supporting these claims. After all, cosmetics companies have been trying to blind us with science for years – perhaps ever since the white coats began to appear in the DuPont chemical company's ads ("Better things for better living … through chemistry") in the 1930s. Recently we've had skin creams loaded with nano-capsules, vitamins A, C and E, antioxidants and things with even longer names.</p>
<p>"The science behind the brand lies in the groundbreaking technology of Glycobiology," one puff piece tells us. "It's been noted as the future in the medical field, the fruit of more than 100 years of research and recognized by seven Nobel Prizes." The Telegraph, meanwhile, parrots the PR that, "the cream has been 20 years in development, and has the backing of the Max Planck Institute in Germany".</p>
<p>I rather wish that, as a chemist, I could say this is all tripe. But it's not as simple as, say, claims by bottled-water companies to have a secret process that alters the molecular structure of water to assist hydration. For example, it's true that glycobiology is a big deal. This field studies an undervalued and once unfashionable ingredient of living cells: sugars. Glycans are complicated sugar molecules that play many important biological roles. Attached to proteins at the surfaces of our cells, such sugars act as labels that distinguish different cell types – for example, they determine your blood group. Glycans and related biochemicals are an essential component of the way our cells recognise and communicate with one another.</p>
<p>Skin cells – essentially, tissue-generating cells called fibroblasts – produce glycans and other substances that form a surrounding extracellular matrix, Some of these glycans attract water and keep the skin plump and soft. But their production declines as fibroblasts age, and so the skin becomes dry and wrinkled. Skin creams routinely contain glycoproteins and glycans to redress this deficit.</p>
<p>Fine – but what's so different about the new cream? It's based on a combination of artificial glycans trademarked Glycanactif. Selfridges tells us that they "unlock the cells to reactivate their vital functions and liberate the youth potential at all levels of the skin". Well, it would be nice if cells really were little boxes brimming with "youth potential", just waiting to be "unlocked", but this statement is basically voodoo.</p>
<p>So I contact YSL. And – what do you know? – they sent me some useful science. It's surrounded by gloss and nonsense ("Youth is a state of mind that cannot live without science"), and exposed as the source of that garbled soundbite from Selfridges. But it also shows that YSL has enlisted some serious scientists, most notably Peter Seeberger, a specialist in glycan chemistry at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces in Berlin. And it explains that, instead of just supplying a source of glycans in the extracellular matrix to make up for their reduced production in ageing cells, Glycanactif apparently binds to glycan receptors on the cell surface and stimulates them to start making the molecules (including other glycans and related compounds) needed for healthy skin.</p>
<p>Tough-skinned cynic that I am about the claims of cosmetics manufacturers, I am nonetheless emolliated – if not exactly rejuvenated. True, there's nothing in the leaflet to prove that FYL does a better job than other skin creams. And the science remains very sketchy in places so (this is true of any claims for cosmetics) we'd reserve judgment until the long-term clinical trials, if it were a drug. But I'm offered a troupe of serious scientists ready to talk about the work and I'm open to persuasion.</p>
<p>Still, it puzzles me. How many of the thousands of advance orders, or no doubt the millions to come, will have been based on examination of the technical data? I know we lack the time, and usually the expertise, for such rigour. So what really informs our decision to shell out 60 quid on a tiny tub of youthfulness? And if the science was all nonsense, would it make a difference?</p>
<p>Their theories are fine, but where are the studies? You would think they would have done some tests - actually, you would think they would be required to have produced some experimental data before they're allowed to say that their new potion is the key to immortality.</p>
<p>I suspect it's a mixture of status symbol coupled with delusion. My skin dehydrates a fair deal. I try to avoid anything remotely astringent apart from red wine, which I am prepared to suffer for - I find E45 (or P45 as I call it) is as good as anything else for remedying the situation.</p>
<p>Only an absolute mug would pay that much for this 'Forever Youth Liberator' (LOL) - that said, some people will pay £800 for a handbag. I can only guess the world is full of mugs.</p>
<p>Thanks for the article. That's exactly the type of skincare product reviews that are so needed. It doesn't stop to astonish me how people (well, women mostly) blindly accept cosmetics companies' claims and part themselves with large amounts of cash in exchange for more often than not useless products. I don't understand how cosmetics companies are allowed to get away with selling total rip offs either. The only way to counteract this until the legislation catches up is, us as consumers to get a chance to read more reviews like this. Personally, I use Paula Begoun's www.beautypedia.com all the time and her unbiased scientific reviews of thousands of products have saved me loads of money. I hope The Guardian make this as a permament feature column in the future.</p>
<p>IF it works (IF) it would ony be maximally effective in conjunction with other activities which promote health (healthy diet, enough sleep, no cigarettes and staying out of the sun). If it doesn't work, well it's only £60 and would probably last you a couple of months so there are certainly more expensive vices to have.</p>
<p>Sadly, it's all just and extension of the belief that homeopathy actually works.</p>
<p>And it doesn't.</p>
<p>I once overheard a family friend praising her new (and expensive) 'wonder lotion' to my ex.</p>
<p>I couldn't resist it, and asked her to explain how the particular 'wonder ingredient' worked.Obviously, she had no idea, so I went upstairs and returned with a huge container of a general purpose cream I'd bought from the chemist. I used to climb. hill-walk, run, and cycle a lot, and it helped chapped and damaged areas.My ex also used it as a moisturiser (dry skin).</p>
<p>I showed her the 'wonder' ingredient in my cream, and yes, it was the same as hers.Mine came in small bucket size.Hers a tiny tub.Both had the same ingredients (mine wasn't perfumed though).Mine cost £4.50Hers £33.99.</p>
<p>Looks like nothing has changed - the gullible are still everywhere, and so are those who take advantage of them and their vanity.</p>
<p>I'd like beauty products to be subject to the same sort of rigour as we apply to other drugs. How many times have we seen an advert where it claims to provide younger looking skin in 90% of cases - only to glimpse the small print showing that this was a study of 47 respondants to a magazine?</p>
<p>Serious scientific trials need to be done before such manufacturers can make claims.</p>
<p>My wife informs me that unless you start using these anti-ageing creams liberally from age 18 they will be as much use as a tub of ordinary moisturising cream.But what do I know?I am just a rugged northerner who slathers his face with lard and thinks that all these airy fairy cosmetic zillionaires are a bunch of money grabbing reprobates.Perhaps if they tried the product out on Anne Widdecombe for a couple of years then revealed an unrecognisable younger version I would believe it, otherwise I'd advise her to keep rubbing on the lard.</p>
<p>Quite.I'd take all these anti-wrinkle creams a bit more seriously if they used women who were old anough to actually have wrinkles to advertise them.The stupid thing is, most women who buy this sort of thing - and I'll include myself among them, though I hope I'm not daft enough to shell out sixty quid for this particular one - know they're buying into sheer fantasy. We know that creams are all pretty much the same, and the only things that stops your skin wrinkling are good health, good genes, and staying out of the sun. So there should be more articles like this, the press, on the whole, are far too uncritical and desperate for the advertising revenue to have a real go at this nonsensical pseudo-science.</p>
<p>Why is she right? Why do you have to start at 18? What would be the point? What 18 year old has wrinkles or other signs of ageing? I use a serum with hylarunic acid in it.. which just temporarily plumps up the skin a bit. As far as I'm aware that's about the most you can expect a product to do.. They don't rid you of wrinkles, they just (might) make them look a little less deep.. So where's the evidence for or the logic in slapping that stuff on at 18?I can see that keeping young skin simply moisturised would be a good idea to keep it supple... and telling young people to keep out of the sun and what not.. But anti-ageing creams? Surely not!</p>
<p>You have answered your own question. It's virtually impossible to get rid if wrinkles with a cream. Like you say, the best you can hope for is to plump up your lines temporarily with a serum. However continued use of a good product can prevent wrinkles from forming. This is the point about starting young. Prevention is better than cure. You don't use anti wrinkle cream at 18 to treat wrinkles, of course that's pridicllus. You use it to prevent them developing (although I agree 18 is maybe a little early).</p>
<p>But they do use slightly older women - and then retouch the photos. Have we already forgotten the Julia Roberts brouhaha of a month ago? Can't remember what potion she was flogging, as I never use them.</p>
<p>I do wish scientists would stop using such metaphors. In the human body, there are events - changes describable in terms of cause and effect - involving cells. There is no "recognition" going on with these cells and certainly no "communication".</p>
<p>The main thing I would do is check the list of ingredients. Very few seem to be concerned about the complex mix of chemicals they are putting on their skins every day. Many of these chemicals are absorbed into the body, as well as the skin, few of them are properöly tested.</p>
<p>In addition, none of them have been tested in mixtures together, so we have no idea what chemical A does wihen mixed with chemical B and absorbed.. and processed through the organs or chemical A, B and C all together.</p>
<p>This product like most I guess will have at least 20 ingredients... add that to the 5-10 other products people rountinely use each day.. the mess is horrible.</p>
<p>If you want to stay healthy, and therefore usually younger looking, cut back on the chemicals and forget all this hype.</p>
<p>So. Pop down to Holland & Barrett. Buy a bottle of Hyaluronic Acid capsules and pop one a day. £10 per month should do it. Our cells lose this natural component as we age and HA helps cells to retain moisture. It is being added to face creams now but i would say better to take it than slap it on.</p>
<p>Chemicals in food are especially a no-no. If you read a label and can't conceive of having all the ingredients in house to make the dish, ie the list looks like what you might find in a chemistry lab, do not put it in your body.</p>
<p>I do think a cream with an SPF of 15 at least is a good idea, but they can be had for £5 or so.</p>
<p>And while i usually buy whatever is on offer in Superdrug, a friend gave me some Frankincense night cream from Neal'sYard and that did have a remarkable effect on my neck especially, even tho neck fine anyway, thanks to doing 2 minutes a day of Eva Fraser's.</p>
<p>I do think a cream with an SPF of 15 at least is a good idea, but they can be had for £5 or so.</p>
<p>Do you mean for young folk? Sure... I just don't buy into the very young slapping on expensive anti-ageing stuff as preventative.. That's just rubbish, in my book.But a decent cleansing routine (hot flannel for me), moisturising, laying off the fags and booze (oops... don't seem to be able to manage that one myself), and staying out of the sun or wearing a good spf when in it (don't over do it though... we need some vit D too)...And all exercise is good... and stay off the junk foods. All these will help keep your skin in relatively good nick.. whatever your age...</p>
<p>The fact that people a) buy this stuff and b) have enough money to spend on it suggest that a) we live in a very very superficial society and b) we need some radical redistribution of wealth to the poor.</p>
<p>Sixty quid? Peanuts! I know a shop where they've got face cream on sale for FIVE HUNDRED EUROS! It comes from Switzerland and claims to contain caviar. I don't know exactly what caviar is supposed to do to your skin, but there you are.</p>
<p>I've got to the age of fifty-five with hardly any wrinkles. And yes, I smoke, and my skincare routine has always been pretty sketchy. You've got the genes, and you don't have the stress, you won't age too much, If you haven't, and you have, you will. And nothing you rub in is going to make a blind bit of difference.</p>
<p>The best thing for anti-aging : a healthy age-appropriate body image - it resists the five signs of insecurity-mongering snake-oil pedlars - whilst maintaining natural vigor, a fuller wallet and sense of dignity.</p>
