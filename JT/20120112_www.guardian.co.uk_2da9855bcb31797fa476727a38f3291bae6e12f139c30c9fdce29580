<p>addicted to the internet</p>
<p>Can you really be addicted to the internet?</p>
<p>Chinese scientists have observed differences in the brains of people who obsessively use the internet similar to those found in people who have substance addictions. Is this proof that the internet can be addictive? Polly Curtis, with your help, finds out. Get in touch below the line, email your views to polly.curtis@guardian.co.uk or tweet @pollycurtis</p>
<p>Several reports today suggest that a study of the brains of people who excessively use the internet show abnormalities similar to those found in people with substance addictions could be proof that the internet has similar addictive qualities to drugs, alcohol or tobacco. The Independent's report here is the most extensive. It says:</p>
<p>Internet addiction has for the first time been linked with changes in the brain similar to those seen in people addicted to alcohol, cocaine and cannabis. In a groundbreaking study, researchers used MRI scanners to reveal abnormalities in the brains of adolescents who spent many hours on the internet, to the detriment of their social and personal lives. The finding could throw light on other behavioural problems and lead to the development of new approaches to treatment, researchers said. An estimated 5 to 10 per cent of internet users are thought to be addicted – meaning they are unable to control their use. The majority are games players who become so absorbed in the activity they go without food or drink for long periods and their education, work and relationships suffer.</p>
<p>But is there really such a thing as internet addiction?</p>
<p>The claim</p>
<p>Internet addiction disorder (IAD) is currently becoming a serious mental health issue around the globe. Previous studies regarding IAD were mainly focused on associated psychological examinations. However, there are few studies on brain structure and function about IAD. In this study, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate white matter integrity in adolescents with IAD.</p>
<p>Methodology/Principal Findings</p>
<p>Seventeen IAD subjects and sixteen healthy controls without IAD participated in this study. Whole brain voxel-wise analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed by tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to localize abnormal white matter regions between groups. TBSS demonstrated that IAD had significantly lower FA than controls throughout the brain, including the orbito-frontal white matter, corpus callosum, cingulum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and corona radiation, internal and external capsules, while exhibiting no areas of higher FA. Volume-of-interest (VOI) analysis was used to detect changes of diffusivity indices in the regions showing FA abnormalities. In most VOIs, FA reductions were caused by an increase in radial diffusivity while no changes in axial diffusivity. Correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between FA and behavioral measures within the IAD group. Significantly negative correlations were found between FA values in the left genu of the corpus callosum and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, and between FA values in the left external capsule and the Young's Internet addiction scale.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that IAD demonstrated widespread reductions of FA in major white matter pathways and such abnormal white matter structure may be linked to some behavioral impairments. In addition, white matter integrity may serve as a potential new treatment target and FA may be as a qualified biomarker to understand the underlying neural mechanisms of injury or to assess the effectiveness of specific early interventions in IAD.</p>
<p>I'm going to look into whether internet addiction is considered a medical condition. I'm also curious about the source of claims that 5-10% of internet users are addicted and unable to control their use and report back. I also wonder whether internet addiction is always a bad thing? Do you have an evidence or experience that might help? Get in touch below the line, email me at polly.curtis@guardian.co.uk or tweet @pollycurtis</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>The Royal College of Psychiatrists told me that psychiatrists in the UK refer to two international sources to define whether a set of symptoms is a diagnosable illness or not. The World Health Organisation publishes International Classification of Diseases periodically, but the last came into use in 1994 and therefore inevitably includes no reference to the internet.</p>
<p>The other source is the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is due to be updated next year. The committees responsible for formulating this policy has been debating whether to include internet addiction in its section on addictions. The current proposals reclassify internet gambling as an addiction rather than a compulsive behaviour but don't include internet addiction in its own right. This is still open to consultation, fiercely contested and subject to new evidence, including potentially the Chinese study.</p>
<p>Last year Charles O'Brien of the University of Pennsylvania, the chair of the addictions committee, said in a press conference reported here, that internet addiction would not be included but that they would recommend future research in the area. The report said:</p>
<p>He [O'Brien] said his work group had considered including sex and Internet addictions as disorders, but decided there was insufficient evidence to allow development of reliable diagnostic criteria for them. Consequently, gambling addiction is slated to be the only disorder formally listed in the behavioral addictions category.</p>
<p>But O'Brien added that, under current plans, sex and Internet addictions would be included in an appendix to DSM-V, intended to encourage additional research that could lead to their inclusion in future editions.</p>
<p>The first and obvious point to make about the Chinese study is that it's very small and therefore not conclusive of anything. The second was made by Colin Drummond, professor of addiction psychiatry at Kings College London, which has the largest research centre for psychiatry in Europe, on the Today programme this morning. You can listen to him here and he's just expanded his argument in a phone interview with me. I asked him whether internet addiction is a medical illness. He said:</p>
<p>No. It's interesting that people who use the internet excessively seem to have different brain structures compared with people who don't but the big issue is whether we are looking at cause or effect. There is quite good evidence that people who engage in substance misuse and addictions and to some extent gambling do have problems with impulse control which fits with abnormalities in the frontal lobes of the brain similar to those in this study. But it is a big leap to go from there to suggest that the internet is re-wiring your brain.</p>
<p>If people have emotional problems and that leads them to use the internet obsessively then they obviously need help to deal with those problems, but that's quite different to saying that the internet is addictive. Perhaps unhappy people or people with impulse control problems may well need some help. I'm not denying it' a problem for individuals, but trying to classify it as an addiction has risks attached to it. They are treating an addiction rather than emotional problems that might lead to the emotional behaviour. Excessively internet use is a symptom not a cause of a person's problems.</p>
<p>Are people drawn to the internet because they have impulse control issues? Probably, that's part of the problem they have. The suggestion form this paper is that it's working the other way round; that it's changing people's brain functioning. The implication people who disapprove of the internet can make is that it's potentially addictive and a bad thing that could harm our youth. In China there has been a considerable problem with the publicity that internet addiction has got. In the 1990s there was one doctor giving teenagers electroshock treatment to try and cure addiction to the internet. There are other examples of programmes set up that use physical punishment to try and stop people from excessive internet use. That's one of the side effects of medicalising and trying to turn this into a disorder instead of seeing it as a type of behaviour.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction or drug addiction is somewhat different from spending a lot of time on social network sites or playing warcraft. It's a problem if you are surfing Facebook instead of doing your A-levels, but it's a different order to losing all your money from gambling or getting liver disease from drinking. We should be much more concerned about alcohol and tobacco addiction which is killing millions around the world.</p>
<p>Drummond is explaining the brain patterns found in the Chinese study as being similar ones found in people who have impulse control problems – but that doesn't mean that the internet is the cause but instead it could be the symptom. He didn't deny that excessive internet use can be a problem for individuals but he argues that it trivialises "real" addictions if other behaviour is included and can warp treatment programmes. If problematic over-use of the internet is a symptom of other emotional problems, there's no point treating the symptom.</p>
<p>But others within the psychiatric community do believe it's a real disorder. The Independent's story reports:</p>
<p>Henrietta Bowden Jones, consultant psychiatrist at Imperial College, London, who runs Britain's only NHS clinic for internet addicts and problem gamblers, said: "The majority of people we see with serious internet addiction are gamers – people who spend long hours in roles in various games that cause them to disregard their obligations. I have seen people who stopped attending university lectures, failed their degrees or their marriages broke down because they were unable to emotionally connect with anything outside the game."</p>
<p>Although most of the population was spending longer online, that was not evidence of addiction, she said. "It is different. We are doing it because modern life requires us to link up over the net in regard to jobs, professional and social connections – but not in an obsessive way. When someone comes to you and says they did not sleep last night because they spent 14 hours playing games, and it was the same the previous night, and they tried to stop but they couldn't – you know they have a problem. It does tend to be the gaming that catches people out."</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Lives can suffer profoundly as a result of overusing the internet whether they are gambling, obsessively using social media sites or playing online games. But whether this means they are addicted to the internet or not is fiercely contested by psychiatrists. Some argue that there is a growing body of evidence such as the Chinese study published this week which suggests that there is a physical effect of internet addiction. But that study was too small to draw conclusions from. It also did not establish whether the brain patterns found in compulsive internet users were a cause or symptom of their behaviour. Others say that regardless, the impact is serious enough for it to require classification.</p>
<p>The counter argument is that in fact problem compulsive use of the internet is a symptom of other conditions. Studies show that many people who cannot control their internet use have other psychiatric disorders as well. If it's taken as a disorder in its own right not only will the true cause of the problem not be identified and treated, but it could also distract focus from "real" substance addictions or mental illnesses.</p>
<p>The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has rejected classifying internet addiction as a disorder in its forthcoming revised guidance that heavily influences diagnosis and treatment in the UK. But it has indicated that further research is needed to settle the debate once and for all. The jury is still out.</p>
<p>Confessions of a self confessed addict</p>
<p>Jonathan Haynes, web news editor at the Guardian, has written the below few paragraphs for us about his obsession with the internet. It's anecdote, rather than evidence, but I think it raises a neat point about whether compulsive use of the internet is always harmful - it's been quite instructive in Jonathan's career. Evidence of his compulsive use can be seen on his twitter home page, here. Jonathan writes:</p>
<p>Addiction to the internet itself seems unlikely, however addiction to accessing information on it, well I'd love to try to argue against that but I cannot. When you find yourself with five columns of Twitter on Tweetdeck on a big screen right in front of you - but your hand still inexplicably reaching for your iPhone to check if what's on Twitter there is even newer … you know there's a problem.</p>
<p>When you've disabled your email accounts because you're on holiday - and yet you still find your phone in your hand and your fingers having moved without you even noticing in search of latest messages … you know it's really not healthy.</p>
<p>When your router breaks and your housemate suggests calling an engineer and living without the internet for a few days and you literally run to the shop to buy a new one because you can't bare the thought of even an evening with connection to the net …</p>
<p>When the last thing you do before you sleep is tweet and the first thing when you wake up, and sometimes when you even wake up in the middle of the night and tweet then too. The internet may not be addictive itself, but it sure helps!</p>
<p>Below the line there are a couple of points related to this. @mattmags makes thids reference:</p>
<p>According to Professor Bruce Hood's latest book, it's not the Internet that you get addicted to, but email and social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. It's the little hit of that you get when someone likes your post, or retweets or otherwise demonstrates approval of your input that is addictive. It's also the fact that it doesn't happen automatically, but only occassionaly, that is the real hook. Like a one-armed bandit, you only get the payback sporadically, and it's that that keeps you coming back for more.</p>
<p>Jonathan says he's hooked on the information the internet brings, Prof Hood writes about addiction to networking sites and @epinoa makes this point:</p>
<p>If it triggers a dopamine response then you can become addicted to it. Not a difficult assessment.</p>
<p>If it does trigger a dopamine response is that coming from the internet or what the person is finding there? Are people addicted to the internet, or to social networks, information, gaming, shopping or pornography?</p>
<p>Prevalence</p>
<p>I've just been speaking with Mark Griffiths from Nottingham Trent University who has been researching online addiction since 1994. I asked him specifically about the prevalence issue. He thinks that the estimations of 5-10% are wildly excessive. However, he does believe that a very small number of people are addicted to the internet in its own right but that that number is over-inflated by others who compulsively use the internet as a symptom of another psychological disorder or people who are addicted to doing things that the internet facilitates like gaming or pornography. He said:</p>
<p>The 5-10% figure comes from a conglomeration of studies. I've been really highly critical of prevalence surveys. None of the instruments that are used assess any kind of severity. They are yes or no questions. For addictive behaviour to be classed as addictive it should have a negative detrimental effect. Those scales measure preoccupation rather than addiction. You can have obsessive gamers or internet users with no detrimental effects.</p>
<p>In all my work on behavioural addictions I define it in terms of six components: salience – it is the single most important things in their lives; mood modification – they use it to get excited or numb themselves; tolerance – they need more of the activity to satisfy cravings; withdrawal – I would expect any genuine addict to experience psychological moodiness and irritability if they stopped and also physiological symptoms such as nausea, shakiness or anxiety attacks; conflict within themselves and with others and a subjective loss of control; and relapse - if you have managed to give up if you engage again you go straight back into old habits. When I've applied that case studies I've come across very, very few fulfil all six of those components.</p>
<p>Alcoholism affects between 1-2% of the adult population. If it really did affect it we would have a treatment centre in every major city. That just hasn't happened. We know people seek treatment and they may be addicted to something they find on the internet. But when we investigate we end up with only a handful of people addicted to the internet in the way others are addicted to alcohol.</p>
<p>According to Professor Bruce Hood's latest book, it's not the Internet that you get addicted to, but email and social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. It's the little hit of that you get when someone likes your post, or retweets or otherwise demonstrates approval of your input that is addictive. It's also the fact that it doesn't happen automatically, but only occassionaly, that is the real hook. Like a one-armed bandit, you only get the payback sporadically, and it's that that keeps you coming back for more.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's that people who have certain things going on in their brain (chemically) are more prone to certain kinds of behaviour, particularly those that block out less pleasant aspects of life. An 'addictive personality', if you like (much as it has become some kind of buzz-phrase). This could include drug or alcohol use but also things like online gambling or just using the internet excessively in general, at the milder (less physically harmful) end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>You only have to watch folk on a train to see obsessive compulsive checking of iToys and other fruit-related gadgets. "I have messages, therefore I am."</p>
<p>Also, try having a conversation with anyone, as you are always interrupted by the phone, which is soooo much more important it has to be checked immediately. The mobile phone heralded the end of civiity.</p>
<p>I've written on similar matters in academic journals, but the reference to biological change as relevant to showing addiction is an oft-repeated fallacy. Our mind IS our brain and vice versa. EVERYTHING we do psychologically, from walking the dog, to standing up, to deciding to skip rope, causes physical changes in the brain. After all, the brain is the physical manifestation of the mind, so where WOULD you expect your thoughts to be physically manifested - in the spleen?</p>
<p>All thoughts arise from the brain, hence all thoughts involve change to brain chemistry. Hence the mere fact that something involves a change to brain chemistry tells us absolutely nothing about whether it is an illness/addiction/etc. You can detect brain changes for a whole variety of every-day normal activities, simply because the brain is the physical manifestation of the mind. Do something with your mind, and there will be a corresponding change in the brain.</p>
<p>Unless someone comes up with evidence that our psychological processes are manifested somewhere OTHER than the brain, can we all please stop acting like changes to brain chemistry are somehow informative?</p>
<p>(if you have university access to periodicals, look up Edwards 'Ethical decisions in the classification of mental processes as mental illness' in Philosophy, Psychology and Psychiatry, and then my reply to Wakefield (forgot the title - something like 'Changing functions' - at the end of the same volume. I apologise for the article being written so badly - it was my first publication, and my writing was embarassingly obtuse, but the ideas still hold up.)</p>
<p>Further to the above - my apologies for referring you to material locked off behind journal paywalls. I'm pretty new to academia (only 5 publications) so it would be a bit arrogant to start up my own website just yet. Without that, the only way to access academic articles is to use university computers or logons (for which the education system pays extortionate amounts of money - despite the academics providing the content for free, reviewing the content for free and advising unsuccessful submitters for free...and then the uni has to pay to access it's own academics' work!). Awful system, but not one I can do anything about.</p>
<p>Incidentally (and I should have stated this in my first post)....PERMANENT change to brain chemistry is a different matter. My criticism is that simply saying 'x causes a change to brain activity' doesn't tell us whether it's a permanent change (and even then, the relationship can be complex), or the kind of normal change we constantly undergo.</p>
<p>Of course the internet is addictive. Anything that delivers to the human brain and senses such a huge ammount of stimuli is bound to be addictive.</p>
<p>This is not altogether a negative thing however. I think that spending "some" time on the internet could be very helpful for those who suffer from psychriatric disorders. Internet use maybe even be used eventually in some patients treatment plans. Not just as stimuli but also as an information tool; informing patients about their conditions whilst their stimuli is raised....</p>
<p>I can add the internet to my list of addictions now. Along with sex, alcohol, cannabis and coffee. It's ok though cos they are ILLNESSES and I'm pretty sure the NHS will pay for me to be looked at and even maybe get some ESA out to fit. Modern life is truly crap.</p>
<p>Re: mattmags, I can believe that, given the way that they repeatedly utilise psychological hooks to draw you back into usage. It reminds me of the way that automatic gambling machines use bells, whistles, and 'special plays' to keep you returning for 'one more round'.</p>
<p>Most non-drug addiction (as far as I understand, and I have absolutely no expertise on the issue) seems to work on the basis of a series of irregular low-payout 'hits' that trigger the brain's reward mechanisms without actually costing the proprietor a great deal (e.g. a series of low-money payouts, or meaningless but psychologically effective Farmville wins, or friendship offers, approving comments, etc). Some internet sites manage to utilise the same method as gambling machines, without having to even make the 'hit' financial.</p>
<p>The sporadic nature also discourages any rational cost-benefit analysis (e.g. recognition that gambling machines are pre-programmed to pay less than they take).</p>
<p>I'm not sure that Facebook is the worst offender. Pornography, combined with the internet, seems like a recipe for huge addiction issues, and it doesn't surprise me that porn-addiction-therapy is a growing industry for both sexes.</p>
<p>I would have to agree that it should be seen as an addiction. I would not classify this as similar to alcohol or drug addiction as there is not a chemical addiction however it is none the less harmful.</p>
<p>Whilst being a stay at home mum I used to frequent a chat room and would spend large amounts of time on the computer, the difference between this and normal life is that you don’t notice the time etc because you are so fully absorbed. I’ve since noticed it in other people using chat room in that when you try to get them away there is always a ‘sure give me 2 minutes’ and this 2 minutes nearly always continues until you call them again, and again.</p>
<p>The worrying thing about this is not the length of time they spend doing this it is more the complete obsession, there seems to be a belief that people who you talk to online are your ‘friends’ regardless of whether you have ever met them. The company I work for has technology in place which reminds you how long you have been playing a game in order to force a reality check, to me this acknowledges peoples inability to do this for themselves.</p>
<p>I use the internet all day whilst at work, that is hardly addiction forming as it is work. As soon as I go home I use the internet to access entertainment. The internet is the delivery method, not an end in itself.</p>
<p>As the internet is merely the method, the supply method, surely the article should be about possibly being addicted to "content delivered via the internet"?</p>
<p>It was harder to be 'addicted' when your mobile phones couldn't access the internet without costing you loads of money. Now I'm glued to the thing. To say I'm addicted would be a stretch, but I could imagine how someone could be.</p>
<p>Not exactly. Lots of things trigger a dopamine response - receiving a text produces a dopamine response. Not sure we could only look for that. Surely if someone derives pleasure from an activity it is producing a dopamine response.</p>
<p>That does mean that basically everything is addictive but you have to draw the line somewhere. It would be interesting if people obsessed with the internet produced more dopamine in response to it - but then again, maybe all that tells us is that they're enjoying it more than most?</p>
<p>And perhaps the reason they are enjoying more than most is a psychological one like a chance to escape to a fantasy world or the ability to be anonymous (and say what you want etc).</p>
<p>In that case is it an addiction or an obsession? If it's an obsession due to escapism, is it a separate disorder or a symptom of something like depression?</p>
<p>Response ot Epinoa - you (yes - you personally!) get a constant stream of dopamine responses in your brain to all sort sof things that you do. Its part of your biochemistry, and you'd probably die without it. Everyone responds to such simple, normal things as smiling, laughing, eating, excercise, sex etc - how do you discriminate whats a healthy and normal response, from one that isn't?</p>
<p>Create an unequal society in the physical real world ie don’t include everyone in the hierarchy. It is a human need to socialize, thus people that are already excluded from the real world sit at home all day communicating with people virtually ie communicating with a computer screen. And people wonder why there is so much mental illness in the western world?</p>
<p>When I was in my early 20s and teenage years, I was so heavily dependant on the internet, be it playing online games (Ragnarok Online was my drug), or just general browsing, it helped me forget my dire working class upbringing and entering the 'Real' world. Whenever I wasn't on it, I had the exact thoughts and worries always bubbling, its kinda whats associated with most drug users, it helps you forget worries, honestly I used to feel like I was in withdrawal whenever I was away from it longer than a day...</p>
<p>Its easy to say, 'oh but all kids play games on the computer at that age' or 'so what its not dangerous', its exactly what I would say to my old friends and family.</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, the dependance was frightening, my social life was down the pan not to mention my academic life because the internet made me feel brilliant. From my own experience, having a top level character on an online game or having a huge forum post count (someone mentioned the same further up, well kinda the same about people reacting to your facebook and twitter updates), gave me such an adrenaline rush and confidence boost that the real world could not offer.</p>
<p>Ironically, now I am not so heavily addicted to the internet, I still consider beating an online game boss that took 20 mins with teamwork (think WoW, Ragnarok) more fulfilling than getting a document approved at work.</p>
<p>We can live so much of our lives online, from paying bills and shopping through to work and leisure activities, it can be difficult to tell an 'addict' from someone just going about their business. The person who is always sat in front of their computer or always has a smartphone in hand might look like an addict in the widely accepted sense but it is what they do when the internet in unavailable that counts.</p>
<p>Surely anything that makes an individual feel "worthwhile" and "happy", could be considered "addictive" in a psychological sense. Such behaviour could include, watching football, shopping, Eastenders or Corrie.</p>
<p>However, in a physiological sense, addictive substances when withdrawn have very physical manifestation, such as extreme emotional responses, cold sweats, shakes, perhaps even heart attacks and death.</p>
<p>Hardly something the internet could cause.</p>
<p>For example. Heroin is addictive, and if withdrawn will cause the addict problems. Cannabis is not, but it is enjoyable for users and is habit forming.It may make the individual less happy if withdrawn.</p>
<p>The word addictive is an overused and misunderstood term, and is often used in a derogitory manner to discourage certain behaviour which makes people happy.</p>
<p>The fact that this research comes from a country, seemingly hell bent on restricting internet access, freedom of expression, and general happiness should not be ignored.</p>
<p>When you find yourself with five columns of Twitter on Tweetdeck on a big screen right in front of you - but your hand still inexplicably reaching for your iPhone to check if what's on Twitter there is even newer … you know there's a problem.</p>
