<p>Well no one has asked me. I am completely happy with my man and yes we have been together for some time married 19 years next May together 22 years next May. i can hand on heart say he has none of the imperfections mentioned. i love him to bits and would not change a thing. i guess i am a lucky one..
Now i have said that he will probably do something to P**s me off this evening now.. lol :o)</p>
<p>Well put this in your pipe and get high: MY HUSBAND WHOM I HAVE ADORED FOR THE LAST 23 YEARS IS PERFECT FOR ME!!!!! Every human has their faults, god know I have mine. But if anyone asked me if I'd change a single thing about my husband, I'd tell them an emphatic NO!</p>
