<p>WITH an insatiable demand for a wonder product that can recapture a
youthful look, some facial lotions and potions can turn into massive sellers.
Here is what happened when three products suddenly became the magic formula
of the moment.</p>
<p>Flavour of the month ... Bottom Butter</p>
<p>Sales of Waitrose Baby Bottom Butter doubled to 30,000 tubs in 2008 as mums
started using it on their faces. In 2011 it was the supermarket's top
skincare line.</p>
<p>Big hit ... Lacura face cream</p>
<p>ALDI had a hit when Lacura Multi-Intensive Serum face cream took off in May
2010. After coming top in a blind test, sales soared by 2,150 per cent.</p>
<p>Sold out ... Boots No7</p>
<p>In 2007, five months' stock of Boots' No7 Protect & Perfect
Beauty Serum sold out in a single day after its merits were featured on a
BBC TV show.</p>
<p>Sugar serum makes you look younger</p>
<p>(but read this with a pinch of salt)</p>
<p>A SKIN serum hailed as the "holy grail" of anti-ageing started flying off the
shelves yesterday.</p>
<p>Forever Youth Liberator from Yves Saint Laurent had already racked up more
than 5,000 pre-orders.</p>
<p>In a trial of 50 women, nine out of ten said their skin looked more luminous
after using the lotion, while 72 per cent said fine lines were less visible.</p>
<p>The range contains synthetic versions of glycans, naturally occurring sugars
in the skin.</p>
<p>Science writer and broadcaster Vivienne Parry says: "Glycobiology is going to
change the world in many areas and it is a very important development in
skincare too.</p>
<p>"Glycans are complicated sugars that play a key role in the structure of the
skin.</p>
<p>"They also sit on the surface of cells and transmit messages to them. Glycans
reduce with age. These glycans can make skin cells act as they would have
when in a younger body."</p>
<p>A study of the technique in the journal Technology Review in 2003 said the
discovery was "one of the ten emerging technologies that would change the
world."</p>
<p>YSL worked with Professor Peter Seeberger, of Germany's Max Planck Institute,
to develop the serum.</p>
<p>He said: "I was surprised YSL was interested in my work. I'm interested in
health, not face paint. Still, we were able to apply our existing techniques
to glycans in skin."</p>
<p>But the search for eternal youth is not cheap. Just 30g — just more than two
tablespoons of the serum — is Ј50.</p>
<p>Skincare wonder products are not new — and often cheaper.</p>
<p>Recent examples include Boots' No7 Protect & Perfect Beauty Serum,
which enjoyed a sales boost after being featured in a 2007 BBC documentary.</p>
<p>And in April 2008 there was a stampede to supermarket shelves as Waitrose's
Baby Bottom Butter sold like hot cakes after parents recommended using the
Ј2.54 cream on their faces too.</p>
<p>Another cheap skin product which took the beauty world by surprise was
supermarket Aldi's Ј3.49 Lacura Multi-Intensive Serum.</p>
<p>The Sun checked out what 30g of other luxury goods would cost you: 30g of
sterling silver costs Ј17.34, 28g of Mottra Sterlet Sturgeon Caviar is Ј55
from online supermarket Ocado and 30g of Fresh Black Winter Truffle is
Ј63.95 from London Fine Foods Group.</p>
