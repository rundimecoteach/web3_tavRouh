<p>New mums should be advised that it is normal for their baby to cry more if they are breastfed, say experts.</p>
<p>The Medical Research Council team says this irritability is natural, and although formula-fed babies may appear more content and be easier to pacify, breast is still best.</p>
<p>If parents have more realistic expectations more may stick with breastfeeding, they hope.</p>
<p>Most UK mums try to breastfeed. Within months the rate drops to a third.</p>
<p>The Department of Health recommends that mothers exclusively breastfeed for the first six months after birth.</p>
<p>The most common reason given for women to stop breastfeeding is that "Breast milk alone didn't satisfy my baby", which the MRC scientists say reflects their perception of irritability as a negative signal.</p>
<p>But they say this crankiness in babies is normal and just their natural way of communicating their needs to their mother and is no cause for alarm.</p>
