<p>Private world: Previous studies have shown people wearing headphones or talking on a mobile phone respond less to external stimuli such as sounds and traffic when crossing the street</p>
<p>Study leader Dr Richard Lichenstein, of the University of Maryland Hospital for Children in Baltimore, said: ‘The use of headphones may pose a safety risk to pedestrians, especially in environments with moving vehicles.’</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown people wearing headphones or talking on a mobile phone respond less to external stimuli, such as sounds and traffic when crossing the street.</p>
<p>Andrew Howard, head of road safety at the AA, said: ‘Pedestrians and cyclists seem to get lost in a private cocoon when they’re on a mobile in the street, or wearing headphones.</p>
<p>‘Precise figures don’t appear to be available here. There are many close calls. You’ve only got to look around to see it’s on the rise.’</p>
<p>What about the cyclists and drivers wearing head/earphones? When I had my first Walkman in 1982 there was a clear warning in the instructions NOT to use it when in control of a vehicle, and to take care as a pedestrian (for most of the time as a pedestrian, you're not actually in any danger - it only becomes really dangerous when you come to cross a road). And yet, 20 years later, it seems that some people still find that to be perfectly acceptable. That absolutely astounds me.</p>
<p>Who actually pays for these "studies" to be carried out. Maybe if we start looking at more important things such as disease prevention or something that will actually benefit the human race we could actually make a difference. As far as im concerned if your stupid enough to walk into oncoming traffiv then you are doing the world a favour by removing yourself from the gene pool.</p>
<p>I see alot of people driving whilst wearing headphones (listening to music?). Surely this must constitute driving without due care and attention? It's up there with driving with music blaring out - daft!! It's hard sometimes to concentrate with the radio on or a small child yellling (!) in the back let alone having earphones in.</p>
<p>Jaywalking is not an offence in this country - we are one of the few countries that do not have an anti jaywalking law and people wonder why pedestrians keep getting knocked down. This will not change while the powers that be decide the motorist is to blame for every accident regardless of fault.
- Frizzen, Cardiff, 17/1/2012 11:39 ______________________________________________________________ There might not be a "Jaywalking Law", but it's illegal illegal to be on the Highway without lawful authority or excuse. Otherwise you are "obstructing the Highway" - you don't have to be obstructing traffic - and that applies equally on pedestrian crossings. Hence police prosecuting protesters who think they can get away with marching backwards and forwards across a road if they do it on a zebra crossing. The pity is, that's the only time you'll ever hear of the police using the law against a dangerous, never mind careless or inconsiderate, pedestrian.</p>
<p>I've no problem with the headphones. It's walking down the street and through doorways while phoning or texting that infuriates me as those that do it are seflish are totally oblivious to what's going on around them.</p>
<p>The problem is as least as much about drivers who don't take the time to check whether people have looked at them, they drive as if people are aware of them by noise. Deaf people are more likely to be hit by cars, that's not because they are doing anything wrong, it's drivers assuming everyone knows they are there. We just need to slow down and watch pedestrians more closely. - Rosa 17/1 7:44 ________________________________________________________________ What would you like drivers to slow to? 0mph? In case a zombie ipod user or, supposedly, a blind person, jogs, without warning, into the middle of their lane, one inch in front of them? Have you ever read the pedestrians' section of the Highway Code? Do you even know it exists! What about pedestrians assuming all drivers know, not only that they are there, but that they are about to dash across the road? If you expect drivers to do that, why do you think it unreasonable for pedestrians to guess there might be cars on the roads?</p>
<p>I live in a area highly populated by students. On 4 occasions this year alone I have had to break swerve to avoid a phone engrossed student stepping of the curb and into the road without a care in the world other than whose tweeting, texting or facebooking them.</p>
