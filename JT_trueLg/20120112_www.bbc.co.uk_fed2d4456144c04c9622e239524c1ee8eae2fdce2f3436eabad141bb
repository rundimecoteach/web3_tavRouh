<p>Length of stay - Latest data shows that patients spend 7.2 days in hospital on average - higher than the international average and twice the figure in Denmark. Improving discharge arrangements, particularly at weekends, would make a big difference</p>
<p>Day case surgery - Everything from hernia repairs and cataract operations to ear, nose and throat surgery can be done as a day case. But again the NHS is lagging behind international best practice</p>
<p>Back-office functions - By standardising and simplifying practices in areas such as HR, finance and IT, £600m could be saved from the £2.8m annual bill</p>
<p>Staffing - Money could be saved through reducing reliance on agency staff and overtime as well as tackling sickness rates through better occupational health</p>
<p>Procurement - The fragmented way basic goods, from gloves to paper, are bought means many places are over paying. About £500m a year - 10% of the consumables bill - could be saved if all trusts bought at the lowest available price</p>
<p>And because costs are rising at a higher rate than this, due to factors such as the ageing population and cost of new drugs, the health service is having to make the £20bn of savings.</p>
<p>The Nuffield Trust said this was presenting a major challenge because productivity had been getting worse over the past decade.</p>
<p>It focused on hospitals because they are the most expensive part of the NHS system, accounting for about £45bn a year - nearly half the entire budget.</p>
<p>The think-tank compared hospital performance against international data as well as taking an in-depth look at how six trusts had turnaround performance.</p>
<p>Judith Smith, head of policy at the Nuffield Trust, said: "It is very difficult to justify cuts if inefficiencies in areas such as rates of day case surgery, length of stay and the purchasing of hospital supplies remain untackled.</p>
<p>"The financial challenge facing the NHS will concentrate minds, but much more needs to be done.</p>
<p>"Why, when so much is known about what drives and can improve efficiency, has hospital productivity deteriorated?"</p>
<p>David Stout, of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, said the Nuffield Trust was "absolutely right" to flag up the need to improve productivity.</p>
<p>"The NHS has a lot to do if it is going to meet the financial challenge it faces and time is running out."</p>
<p>Health minister Simon Burns added: "We agree the NHS should and can be more efficient and improve the quality of its services at the same time."</p>
