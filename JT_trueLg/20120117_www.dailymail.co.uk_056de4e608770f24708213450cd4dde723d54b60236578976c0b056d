<p>Mr Rodriguez panicked at first because he had spent three weeks in the hospital with pneumonia in the spring and knew he had to pay part of the $40,000 cost.</p>
<p>But he quickly realised the terrifying invoice couldn’t be right. He called the billing company and found out he wasn’t the only one with sticker shock.</p>
<p>The billing firm, PHY Services, said it was a simple mistake: The subcontractor that prints the bills put the invoice number into the 'amount due' field.</p>
<p>The company has apparently been deluged with complaints and said it would be sending out an apology.</p>
<p>A recording for callers says: 'If you are calling with respect to a billing statement for services provided at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, please disregard the statement. You will be receiving a new statement shortly. '</p>
<p>Mr Rodriguez said that even though no harm was done to his bottom line, the sloppiness surprised him.</p>
<p>'It was a big error,' he said. 'I think they should have somebody look over the bills before they send them out.'</p>
<p>Hospital spokesman Errol Schneer said he didn’t blame Mr Rodriguez for being upset.</p>
<p>Now those idiots will blame it on "computer error" when it was humans who programmed in that mistake in the first place !!
Didn't *ANYONE* test the program and check the results *BEFORE* it was delivered to the users ?? What about the users ?? Did they do a User Acceptance Test (UAT) *BEFORE* deploying the program live ??
Now, that poor computer is going to get the blame !!</p>
