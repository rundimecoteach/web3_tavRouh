<p>The street drug ecstasy that was responsible for five recent Calgary-area overdose deaths was laced with other, more potent compounds, according to toxicology results.</p>
<p>Ecstasy laced with other drugs, including methamphetamine, has been found by toxicology tests to have been ingested by five recent overdose fatality victims. Calgary police showed this ecstasy Wednesday at a news conference.(CBC)</p>
<p>Paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMMA) and methamphetamine were present in the lab results for each of the recent deaths, the chief medical examiner's office said.</p>
<p>Officials believe each of the overdose victims thought they were taking straight ecstasy (MDMA).</p>
<p>“This is a prime example of the gamble people take when they use illegal drugs,” said Calgary police drug unit staff Sgt. Mike Bossley.</p>
<p>“You never know what is in your drug: yesterday, it was MDMA, today, it’s PMMA, and tomorrow, it could be something else. There is no safe street drug, and no safe dose of a street drug,” he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Yarema, medical director of the province’s Poison and Drug Information Service (PADIS), said while they can look similar, there are important differences between ecstasy and methamphetamine.</p>
<p>“Although all have toxic effects, PMMA is considered more toxic than MDMA, with a higher incidence of seizures and elevated body temperature.”</p>
<p>Methamphetamine can also be slower to act, prompting users to take several tablets to get the desired effect, he said.</p>
<p>Police are still investigating the source of the drugs taken in each of the deaths. The names of the victims are not being released for privacy reasons.</p>
