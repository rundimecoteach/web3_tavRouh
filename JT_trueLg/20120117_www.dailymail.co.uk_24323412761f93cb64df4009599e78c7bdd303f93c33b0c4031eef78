<p>'Organic' sperm donor who has fathered 14 children admits he is a 36-year-old VIRGIN</p>
<p>Trent Arsenault hit the headlines last December when his free sperm bank came under investigation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which threatened him with a $100,000 fine and up to a year in jail.</p>
<p>Now, the Fremont, California local who bills himself as having an ideal gene pool to father children, has revealed that he is a 36-year-old virgin.</p>
<p>Father of 14: Trent Arsenault is a virgin at 36 yet has fathered an astonishing 14 children by donating his sperm to needy couples</p>
<p>The revelation on Anderson Cooper's daytime show, Anderson, means that the self-confessed tech-geek, an expert in Silicon Valley, finds himself in the highly unusual position of never having had sex, but fathering 14 healthy offspring.</p>
<p>Speaking on the chat show, Mr Arsenault said: 'I coined this term "donor sexual" and I'll explain it means 100 per cent of my sexual energy is for producing sperm for childless couples to have babies. So I don't have other activity outside of that.'</p>

<p>Dan, Manchester, 17/1/2012 12:19 Its simply because they cannot understand a human doing something for another human out of kindness which says more about them than it does him,who no doubt has just not met miss right yet.</p>
<p>How are so many people diagnosing him with Aspergers from an article made up
of a few paragraphs? I had to read back through and still can't see why. If it was a sucessful career woman who had also acted as surrogate for multiple partners but had no interest in intimate relationships, I doubt so many would be shouting 'Aspergers!'. I'm not saying he hasn't, but just wondering where all the amature doctors are coming from an how hey got that from 'doesn't want a relationship and donates sperm'.</p>
<p>i have seen average looking people having the most beautiful of children. - Halo, Norwich/Norfolk, 17/1/2012 08:40 That is so true! There is a couple who live not too far from me who are errr.. not easy on the eye... However they have a daughter who stops traffic when she walks down the street. Tall, blonde with the prettiest face. Strange but true.

<p>Richardf, Back of beyond, UK, 17/1/2012 I think it goes two wrongs can make a right hey chuckles to herself . . Oh and to you sad bunch still wrapped up in his looks i say this what have you to be proud of today?,you are sat hidden behind a screen abusing a stranger gives you a very slow clap.</p>
<p>It is thanks to selfless men like this that we conceived our longed for daughter. We had spent 3.5k at clinics and had ran out of money.
He didn't charge and just wanted to help couples have a baby. He is a clean as whistle and I had seen all of his medical certificates saying so.
Do you know your partner is clean when you first meet them?
Keep up the good work I say!
And for those saying it's not right, you cannot comment till you find yourself in that position!</p>
