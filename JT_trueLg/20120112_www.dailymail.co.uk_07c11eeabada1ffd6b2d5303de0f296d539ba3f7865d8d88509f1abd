<p>The author is giving all royalties from the promotion to Farms for City children, a charity he set up with his wife in 1974.</p>
<p>He said: ‘I’m pleased that nine million children in Britain will be receiving copies of my books during this promotion.’</p>
<p>Charlie Powell, Campaigns Director of the Children's Food Campaign, was critical of McDonald’s, saying: ‘At a time when we have a childhood obesity epidemic this is clearly an inappropriate marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Nuggets of information: Health campaigners have suggested McDonald's is using cynical marketing tactics to get children to eat its fast food</p>
<p>Mudpuddle promotion: Nine million of Morpurgo's series, aimed at younger readers, will be given away with Happy Meals</p>
<p>‘The idea appears to be designed to make fast food more attractive to children, which is not the direction we should be going in.’</p>
<p>He added: ‘You have to question whether it is McDonald’s role in society to improve childhood literacy.</p>
<p>‘This seems rather cynical to me. McDonald’s has been criticised in the past for using toys to promote Happy Meals, it seems they have moved to the next most acceptable thing, which is books for children.’</p>
<p>Some nine million of the books, which will also be available to purchase at McDonald’s restaurants without the need to buy a meal, will be distributed.</p>
<p>McDonald's said the move was driven by research released by the National Literacy Trust in December which revealed that almost four million children in Britain – one in three – do not own a book.</p>
<p>Director of the Trust, Jonathan Douglas, said: ‘Our recent research showed that one in three children in this country don’t own a book, which is extremely concerning as there is a clear link between book ownership and children's future success in life.</p>
<p>High profile: Mr Morpurgo's book War Horse has just been adapted for the big screen by Hollywood legend Steven Spielberg</p>
<p>‘We are very supportive of McDonald’s decision to give families access to popular books, as its size and scale will be a huge leap towards encouraging more families to read together.’</p>
<p>Publisher at HarperCollins Children’s Books, Ann-Janine Murtagh, said: ‘We are delighted to be offering mums, dads and children the chance to enjoy books when they visit McDonald’s.</p>
<p>‘We hope it will provide a great experience of reading together and also introduce them to the wonderful world of stories by inspiring authors such as the marvellous Michael Morpurgo.</p>
<p>‘There are so many fantastic children’s books available today that we feel sure this promotion will encourage families to go on and discover more books and the huge fun to be had in reading.’</p>
<p>Neither McDonald’s nor HarperCollins was able to provide a comment from Mr Morpurgo to confirm his enthusiasm for the scheme.</p>
<p>McDonald’s put forward reality TV’s Jeff Brazier, who had two children with Jade Goody, as a spokesman for the scheme.</p>
<p>He said: ‘Reading was a big part of my childhood. A real treat for me was sitting down with football annuals and comic books that I'd bought with my granddad.</p>
<p>‘Knowing what a head start it gave me, I now try to read as much as I can with my boys. Reading to them at bedtime is the perfect end to their day.’</p>

<p>Well done, if one child reads the book instead of playing with that awful plastic toy they normally give away.....it is a success.
I don't care what incentive they give to make a child pick up a book, it's getting a child to read and enjoy reading that counts.</p>
<p>We have many of his books at home, they are so brilliant and cover quite deep issues in a manner that gets children thinking. He is a genius and by using Happy Meals to give this wonderful gift to a more varied audience of children is also very insightful. Many children don't have access to books and if this promotion can excite and ignit a love of stories for the children and even their parents why not. Happy Meals are not Causing obesity, they are a treat on the odd occasion, only when used as an everyday option do they become a diet problem - that's don to poor parenting so encouraging a love of reading and using their imagination may help on all counts. Profits going to city farms again offers better choices and an uplifting option for a day out to many people without access to countryside or animals in real life. Good on him in all counts x</p>
<p>Those children that's parents use McDonald's for more than an occasional treat are probably the same time of parents that don't encourage their children to read by buying them books so I think its a great idea to give those children access to free books and as for those of us who do use the place as an occasional treat I think a book is better than a piece of cheap plastic.</p>
<p>This is a top idea. Mcds is one of the biggest brands in theworld. No matter what you will not stop people going there and places like it because of the society we have rightly or wrongly become. Kids will be thinking ' hey a free book with my burger, thats cool' not the other way around which gives them something to pick up on more often and maybe walk into a bookstore in the future. And totally agree with the eating habits views. It is all about moderation and exercise.</p>
<p>If giving away free books to kids gets them to read then who cares who is giving them away. Anything that motivates reading is to be commended. DM are just being doom masters yet again and trying to twist the argument. Nothing wrong with Macdonald's in moderation.</p>
<p>I think we should be congratulating Mr Morpurgo not condemning him. As a child I had the opportunity to visit the Nethercott Farm in Devon. I lived in Greenwich and it was an amazing experience to be in the country and experience life on a working farm. I'm 37 now and have never forgotten the wonderful experience (and amazing clotted cream we brought home for Mum!!). Let's all do our bit to raise money for this worthwhile charity and give other city kids the opportunity to create memories for the future.</p>
<p>Here we go again .......There is nothing whatsoever unhealthy about McDonalds , unless it is eaten in unhealthy AMOUNTS . and that applies to ALL food . If someone ate nothing but lettuce , tomato , carrot , and fruit, for say ten days , then a good old portion of burger and chips would be more healthy than to carry on eating more salad and fruit.....common sense and moderation in all things is the best policy ......</p>
<p>Oh good Lord - you don't want toys in happy meals because it rewards kids for eating junk food. Now you don't want books because you don't want literacy associated with junk food. Maybe all these namby pamby do-gooders should just go away. A happy meal isn't any more junk food that all the processed garbage their parents are feeding them at home. At least now they come with apple pieces and milk. Maybe let the kids have a little fun and be kids once in a while. I'd rather the kids have books in their happy meals. Leave me alone to raise my children as I see fit and I won't go butting into your life cause I'm sure you've got things you wouldn't like me trying to regulate.</p>
