<p>eMoney News  News in-depth: One-third of primary school-leavers is obese, report finds</p>
<p>15 Dec 2011</p>
<p></p>
<p>A new study has found that more children are now obese when they leave primary school than ever before.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The NHS Information Centre's figures show that more than one-third of ten and 11-year-olds are lasses as clinically obese, even though the number of overweight youngsters starting school is lower than it was in 2006.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some 34.9 per cent of boys aged ten and 11 were obese, while the corresponding figure for girls was 31.8 per cent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Health experts said the problem could be down to school dinners at some institutions being unhealthy, as well as children beginning bad eating habits at home and snacking between meals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Shadow public health minister Diane Abbott said: "What is needed is nothing short of a revolution and yet the government is really struggling with the basics."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"This means that while fewer than one in ten children in reception year are obese, for children in their final year of primary school this prevalence is nearly one in every five," added NHS Information Centre spokesperson Tim Straughan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Public health minister Anne Milton commented: "In January we will launch a new Change4Life campaign to help families follow a balanced diet."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cashless catering using smart cards could help schools to bring in healthier eating plans for children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The cards can collect data on what is being purchased by youngsters, which then allows officials to alter menus in order to improve the canteen's offerings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since parents can also monitor what is being bought online from home, carrying the cards may also be an incentive for children to make nutritious choices in order to avoid a lecture when they get back from school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Earlier in 2011, health secretary Andrew Lansley said Britons need to cut a collective five billion calories a day off their current intake in order to fight obesity, since most people are getting much more than they need. </p>
