<p>20hoursagoFDA fines Red Cross nearly $9.6 million for blood safety lapsesGetty Images / FileThe American Red Cross is facing a new multi-million-dollar fine for problems with blood collection and distribution. By JoNel AlecciaFederal health officials have fined the American Red Cross nearly $9.6 million for sloppy and unsafe blood management practices, the second multi-million-dollar penalty levied against the agency in the last two years.The new Food and Drug Administration fine follows inspections at 16 Red Cross blood centers between April and October 2010 that revealed ongoing problems that appeared to endanger donors and to allow potentially contaminated blood into the nation’s supply.An FDA spokeswoman said the agency found no evidence of actual harm to blood recipients and that officials remain confident about sources of blood in the U.S.</p>

<p>But, spokeswoman Patricia El-Hinnawy added, problems at the Red Cross, which supplies 40 percent of the nation’s blood, are worrisome.“FDA cannot definitively say there was never any danger to the blood supply since the violations can create conditions that could lead to potential safety consequences,” said El-Hinnawy.The violations were outlined in a 32-page letter sent Jan. 13 to J. Chris  Hrouda, executive vice president of Biomedical Services for the Red Cross. They describe a blood collection system plagued with poorly trained staff and inadequate record-keeping where donated blood was mishandled or misplaced and, in some cases, potentially infected blood was transfused into patients.“ARC has known of these continuing problems and has failed to take adequate steps to correct them,” wrote Evelyn Bonnin, director of FDA’s Baltimore District.But a Red Cross spokeswoman said in a statement that the problems primarily centered on an inspection at a Philadelphia site conducted 15 months ago and that the agency has since addressed many of the issues.“We are disappointed that the FDA believed it necessary to impose a fine for an inspection conducted so long ago,” wrote Stephanie Millian, director of biomedical communications. “We are not aware of any adverse donor reactions or patient issues due to the problems in the FDA report.”The latest fine, however, follows a $16 million fine in June 2010 for similar failures and caps nearly two decades of trouble at the Red Cross.  About 17 million units of blood are donated each year and about 15 million units are transfused, according to a 2009 survey conducted by AABB, an international association of blood products groups.The Red Cross has been operating under terms of a consent decree first issued in 1993 and then amended in 2003 to allow the FDA to impose stiff fines for ongoing failures to meet regulations and laws governing quality and safety of the nation’s blood supply. The problems detected then were the same ones that have not, apparently, been addressed now: overworked staff, sloppy clinical practices and inadequate record-keeping.</p>

<p> Follow me on Twitter Problems outlined in the Jan. 13 letter include failure to process and review records of donor reactions and injuries, including a backlog of some 15,000 records in Charlotte, N.C.Certain Red Cross sites have not been keeping an accurate list of deferred donors who should be barred from giving blood because of infections or other potential problems, the letter said.Others weren’t conducting “lookback” investigations to track down blood from donors who turned out to have infections and to notify patients who might have received potentially contaminated blood.Still others didn’t investigate complaints or other notices of problems, including a donor who was sprayed with blood during a mobile blood drive at the Heart of America regional center in Peoria, Ill., in 2009.In Arizona in 2010, inspectors said a phlebotomist at a Red Cross center stuck herself with a needle and then stuck a patient with the same needle to draw a unit of blood, but no one reported the incident for a month.FDA officials said that the Red Cross has taken steps to address previous violations, including new standardization of procedures, an upgrade and consolidation of national testing laboratories and increased oversight from biomedical headquarters.El-Hinnawy stressed that donating blood is safe and that the risks of receiving a transfusion are far less than failing to receive blood when it’s needed.“FDA strongly encourages people who are in good health to donate blood and become regular blood donors,” she said.  Related stories: Donating your body to science?

<p>I will be the first to admit I don't want that lifestyle. I don't want to work that hard and that long everyday. Call it what you want, but I want to work and go home at the end of the day. Those welders, cops, electricians, and teachers go home at the end of the day and do whatever they want. A true CEO of a company never puts work down.</p>
<p>It's just the type of personality they have and not everyone can do it. On the contrary you can train anyone to do the jobs you mentioned. You can't train a work ethic, and it takes one hell of a work ethic to climb the corporate ladder.</p>

<p>The Red Cross uses only 3.9% of it's budget for administrative expenses. Another 3.8% goes to fund raising efforts.  The Red Cross uses 92.1% of the money it raises to support it's charitable programs.  This is actually a very high number by the standards of most charities.  The President/CEO Gail McGovern makes just a little under $1 million ($995,718) which is not a high salary at all when you consider that she is running an organization with revenues of just under $3.6 billion.6 votes#1.13 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 8:21 PM ESTKO7PjimI guess we could fix this by discontinuing blood drawing for 6 months to get this all sorted out.

<p>This whole thread is full of failures.  Your source specifically posts the data you quoted to debunk it.  It states quite clearly that the efficiency is 92%, which means that 92 cents of every dollar goes where it is supposed to go.  That 39 cents number is a lie.</p>
<p>Also a failure is you thinking that "0.39 cents" is the same as "$0.39."  A quarter, dime, and four pennies are not "0.39 cents," but rather are "39 cents," or "$0.39."  Look up to where I say something about our education system and math.</p>

<p>A better question is this: why is there no outrage that our education system failed people such as yourself?  You look at a site that shows the data you quoted, but has large, bold, font stating "MOSTLY OUTDATED AND INACCURATE" and you can't understand what that means!</p>

<p>You have been fooled far more than you think, and it's not by the Red Cross.  Snopes, aided by Forbes,  indicates that the Red Cross is far from corrupt but rather highly efficient with directing their funds appropriately.</p>

<p>#1.27 - Tue Jan 17, 2012 5:07 AM ESTWill-1091847Blood transfusions are medieval medicine that is seldom actually needed.  The only reason it is still done is because of the tremendous PROFIT the Red Cross makes from SELLING the blood you DONATED to the hospitals.</p>
<p>My father-in-law has had open heart surgery, a hip replacement, and tumor removed from his neck all without a drop of blood being transfused.  How do they do it?  First of all, you find a surgeon who is very skilled and careful when doing the surgery.  If they are afraid to do a surgery bloodless, beware - they are probably NOT in the habit of being careful inside patients.  Using a laser for cutting vs. a scaple also helps.  There are also various machines that can salvage blood that has bled out, clean it up, and infuse it back into the patient.  In the end, the doctors told us that my fatherinlaw recovered more quickly because he did not have a transfusion.  Transfusing someone elses blood weakens the immune system and slows down healing after surgery, not to mention the obvious problems from exposure to unsafe blood.</p>
<p>Medieval medicine I tell you.#1.28 - Tue Jan 17, 2012 6:39 AM ESTtrust2112So which is worse? Dying by lack of adequate blood supply, or dying by blood infested with AIDS? This has been an ongoing problem since the discovery of AIDS in the mid 80's. Before that it was blood tainted with Hepatitis, Herpes or Gonorrhea. Which means there has always been infected blood and it happens. That is why I donate, but only with the consent that if I ever need surgery, I get my own blood FIRST.

He stated that many times the red cross charged the Marines and Soldiers a nickel (1952-54) for a doughnut and coffee.....when they came out of battle... I never new him to lie or exaggerate. Other charities were there who freely supported our troops-- of which he gave freely to them....   </p>
<p>fining a charity makes no sense- when in the end--- they fine those who are kind enough to give to a disrespectful organization1 vote#2.10 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 11:29 PM ESTsurvivor1During a particularly long below zero cold spell 2 yrs. ago, I saw a woman pushing a cart on the street who was obviously homeless and freezing.  I stopped at the local Red Cross and asked them if someone came in who didn't have a warm coat nor any money to pay for one, would they give one to someone.  They said "No.  They would have to pay like anyone else."  I told them I was under the impression they were there to help those in need as I pointed to all the coats they had hanging there.  I repeated my question and was met by the head of operation there.  He said the same thing.  I was so appalled and firmly expressed my "displeasure" with their mind set and policy.  I bought a couple coats and ran around town looking for this woman.  She was so appreciative and told me she had been to the Red Cross in the small town of under 7,000 people, and had asked for help a few days before I stopped there and she was refused a coat or any type of help.  We don't have very many homeless people in that town at all.  She told me someone stopped her on the street and told her they had paid for a room for her in one of the smaller hometown motels and she expressed to me how grateful she was for the kind people in the town.  I gave her the coats and she went to the room that some kind Soul had paid for her to stay in.  I was and still am so angry at the Red Cross for denying her a basic piece of human survival in the cold weather we have here.  Especially so, as they had rack after rack of warm coats she could have chosen one from and it wouldn't have hurt their profit one bit.  I am more than angry, I am pi##ed, and will never set foot in that place again or donate to them like I have in the past.  I felt so bad for this woman and was so mad at the Red Cross people that when I got home, I sat and bawled.  I never saw the homeless woman again. When I told my friends what had happened they were as stunned as I was.  This is how the Red Cross treats people?  Is it like that everywhere or just here?  Absolutely disgusting.#2.11 - Tue Jan 17, 2012 12:49 AM ESTjpegNicodermus...if you read the article, then you would know the answer.... apparently none!#2.12 - Tue Jan 17, 2012 5:12 AM EST</p>

<p>The new Food and Drug Administration fine follows inspections at 16 Red Cross blood centers between April and October 2010 that revealed ongoing problems that appeared to endanger donors and to allow potentially contaminated blood into the nation’s supply.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is why those that desire "Government out" of the people's business, should think twice. If we get rid of these protective agencies, we all going to suffer the consequences.21 votes#3 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 4:34 PM ESTJohnnyOnTheSpot-3794903This is an example of this administration coming down hard on a charitable organization.  The administration wants the Government to provide services that organizations like the Red Cross already provide.  The article says there have been ongoing problems for two Decades, yet they wait for an election year to fine them even though the relevant inspection was done over 1 1/2 years ago.  If the NRC's procedures were such that they warranted 25 million dollars in fines they should have been shut down until proper changes were made.  I have faith in our blood supply, and question the governments motives for such a large fine in an election year, especially when the NRC is just going to get more funds from the U.S. gov. 4 votes#3.1 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 5:15 PM ESTalspinIf you believe that the Red Cross is a chariable orginization, you need to have your head examined.

It markets its products ~ blood, plasma, cryo, and platelets for a competitive price with private blood banks.  Any profits remaining at the end of the fiscal year have to be plowed back into the operation and cannot be used for charitable contributions. salaries, bonuses, etc.  Blood Services should not be confused with ARC Chapters which engage in disaster relief and other individual assistance.

I took it for 2 weeks, didn't like the side effect of dizziness and sleeplessness so I stopped and suffered through the vomiting. 3 months after my son was born a lawyer contacted me about a civil suit about Compazine causing birth defects, emotional issues in children, etc. These side effects had been known about for 2 years but the FDA approved it anyway.</p>

He said those donuts were hard as rocks but when he dipped then in the coffee - 'they were the best things he ever ate'.  At the same time the Red Cross had no presence at the front.  I won't go into the stuff he said about the Red Cross.  Can't use that type of language here.</p>

<p>here is the data you re tested.</p>
<p>http://www.growyouthful.com/tips/adverse-drug-reactions.php#9.3 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 7:12 PM ESTboom! reasonWhenever you take a look at information, the first question you should ask yourself is this: "is this information accurate?"</p>
<p>Considering that this information is from a book this guy is selling and not in medical journals, the answer to that question is "no, it is not accurate."</p>
<p>Keep in mind that "adverse drug reactions" is not a tracked cause of death, so it is not exactly easy to estimate how many people die per year since it relies on statistical analysis.</p>
<p>When this statistical analysis is used to help scare people into buying a book, the credibility further diminishes.</p>
<p>Here are the real facts: "adverse drug reactions" has not been studied well enough (statistical estimates vary wildly) for you to trumpet that it is the 4th cause of death.#9.4 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 9:39 PM ESTupright1AMEN William.</p>
<p>Here are a couple more studies for you</p>
<p><</p>
<p><#9.5 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 11:29 PM ESTupright1Well heck.. just look it up.. type in how many deaths yearly from pharmaceuticals? You'll get hundreds of studies, and most estimate that 100 thousand people die each year from side effects, not from medical malpractice, but side effects of pharmaceuticals.#9.6 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 11:35 PM ESTboom! reasonI don't doubt that many people die per year from drugs -- it's a known fact.</p>
<p>However, you state that there are hundreds of studies, and most estimate more than 100,000 deaths per year, which is false.  You are seeing the same study cited on a variety of websites, not many different studies.</p>
<p>There are very few studies on the subject, and even fewer legitimate studies on the subject -- that figure of 100,000 per year does not appear in any medical journal, which speaks to its (lack of) credibility.</p>
<p>Scientific American, which is well-known and considered by many people to be the Grande Dame of science magazines and the definitive source for science news, states that total US accidental deaths per year (which includes car accidents and drug deaths, to name two) totaled 117,809 in 2005.  Of that 117,809 figure, car accidents were the number one cause of accidental death with 39,252 fatalities, and drug sources (which comprised mainly overdoses of both prescription and illegal drugs) was second.</p>
<p>Yearly deaths from pharmaceuticals is nowhere near what you think it is.  You just need to look at legitimate sources for your information.</p>
<p>Notice who is stating your "more than 100,000 per year figure" and you'll see that it's someone trying to sell you something.  And while you may or may not have purchased their book, you did buy their lie.</p>
<p>And even if it was not a lie, 100,000 deaths per year accounts for under 0.03% of the US population.  To put this in context, more babies are born than that in the United States every 10 days.#9.7 - Tue Jan 17, 2012 1:49 AM ESTjpegBoom!</p>

<p>Back to this issue of fining the Red Cross---I wonder how many members of Congress wash their hands after going to the bathroom. And Gosh sure hope none of them are in a disaster and need blood some day------and their supply may be delayed due to the lack of planes/cars and funds once donated but used to pay off a ridiculous fine----- rather saving your life!</p>

<p>The American Red Cross, by the way, is a very, very profitable not-for-profit.  Take a look at my experience as a member of the Board of Directors of one of the regionals - see post #10.4 votes#11.1 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 5:11 PM ESTTalk to the HandOh and Bruce and all you other naysayers and "they are very profitable" morons. I hope like hell you don't need them should a disaster occur in your neighborhood. They HAVE to have some money in the coffers for the "just in case" scenarios. What would you do if you needed their help and they simply responded 'WE are waiting for enough donations to come in so that we can mobilize. You see as a non-profit we are not allowed to have reserves set aside for immediate and extensive relief mobilizations. Thanks for calling and we will get to you as soon as we can".2 votes#11.2 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 5:20 PM ESTadashiIf you need a blood transfusion,remember the people that died from comtaminated blood from the red cross.In 1994 I had to have several tranfusions and my doctor had me take several HIV tests over the next year because he said that the blood supply from the red cross just might not be safe. i did not get infected but that added a lot of stress.The rat bast..ds went to my workplace begging for more blood donors even though they were charging the insurance over 100 dollars a pint for the blood.6 votes#11.3 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 5:20 PM ESTRobert-2302414@talk to the hand- You must work for the red cross. I was in the military, too and I saw first hand what the red cross does to help people. HAH!!!!!!!!5 votes#11.4 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 7:13 PM ESTKsandraThe Red Cross is not a government agency. It is a private non profit organization. It falls under the FDA rules and inspections due to it's pharmaceutical branch that collects and sales blood and blood products.</p>
<p>The blood it collects may be donated but the blood it provides to patients is NOT free. It sales the donated blood. While I grant there are expences involved in the collection, storage, and distribution so fees have to be charged for the supplied blood they do seem a tad over the top coming from a supposed non profit. </p>
<p>This is not the first time there have been issues with ARC blood collection and distribution. They actively covered up that HIV was indeed transmitted by blood products such as clotting factors for Hemophiliacs back in the early days of the spread of HIV. Many young men and children died because they were told their medication was safe when it was already known that was not true.</p>
<p>I am very grateful there are two universal donors in my immediate family so we are not at the mercy of this organization should one of us need blood.2 votes#12 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 4:59 PM ESTJim in TexasThe greatest costs for blood products is not from collection, storage, and distribution.  It is from testing mandated by the FDA and applicable to all blood banks.  Preparing transfusable products is not a perfect science ~ it will never be.  But because of the required tests now imposed on blood products, coupled with donor qualifications which reject potential donors, it is among the safest of products available.  Remember, blood is a living organism and as such poses certain biological hazards ~ even well tested, approved blood.  Few end users will accept whole blood ~ it is filtered to remove undesirable characteristics and the plasma is extracted.  Its a costly process. #12.1 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 7:51 PM EST</p>

Another incident, my house burned, we lost everything except our car and our lives,I asked the red cross for some help,they offered to loan me 40 dollars,but I had to sign a note that the money would be paid back.

<p>Lanikai Ron$25.6 million dollars in government fines to a charitable organization that serves the public good since I helped vote Obama into office. Is this just another one of the Democrat Party's ways of taxing the people without making them feel thay are being taxed? No evidence of harm to patients or blood supplies? Sneaky way of funding another government agency if you ask me. The FDA inspectors are making sure their paychecks are covered.1 vote#21 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 5:41 PM ESTalspinYou are so ill informed about the red cross, what ever help they give is federally funded. They sell the blood that you donate so they can pay the large salaries to the executives.1 vote#21.1 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 5:56 PM ESTLanikai RonWhat's so uniformed about stating the simple fact that one government agency fines another agency that is federally funded, as you say? You seem to think that the Red Cross doesn't perform anything worthwhile. I can tell you from experience that they are the first to react to emergencies. Feet on the ground before those wonderful feds of yours can organize a conference call to discuss what is going on and what to do next? Then again, I guess it's only the 47% of us that pay taxes that take the time to contribute to charitable organizations. The rest of the population expects us to carry that load as well.#21.2 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 6:16 PM ESTBruce -848280Ron, the American Red Cross is NOT a government agency and is NOT federally funded.  In some emergencies such as Katrina, the Feds provide specific grants to the Red Cross to do specific activities.  Read some of the other posts for some real horror stories about the Red Cross.  They do, however, have a very good public relations program.1 vote#21.3 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 7:42 PM ESTLanikai RonBruce, I was responding to alspin's comment about them being federally funded. My experience with the Red Cross has been positive, sorry. I know Red Cross folks here in Hawaii that have been sent to different emergencies on the mainland several times and I know they have done good work. Who do you think should take their place, FEMA? In a major emergency, they'll show up after the Red Cross' foot troops have been there for weeks. Everytime a family's home burns here, the Red Cross is the first to show up to provide assistance with temporary shelter.

When you donate to the red cross less than $.25 cents for every dollar is to help, the rest goes to executives. The red cross should be taken over by true volenteers and not run by profit taking CEO's who use the company jet to take family and friends on vacation.

During WW2 the Secretary of War sent a letter to the ARC stating it was not fair that our Allies were forced to pay for coffee and doughnuts from their support services but our troops were getting theirs free so if the ARC wanted to continue operating in the theatre of war they must charge or the Secretary of War threatened to have them removed. And by the way, I hate the ARC, they're full of fraud on both the disaster and biomedical side...but I have seen this letter.#23.2 - Tue Jan 17, 2012 1:14 AM ESTunkn0wn1If you pay minimum wage you get minimum work.1 vote#24 - Mon Jan 16, 2012 5:52 PM ESTted415784Does this mean the Money I donated to the Red Cross just went to waste?</p>
