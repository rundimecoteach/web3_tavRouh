<p>Homicide was not one of the nation's top 15 causes of death in 2010, according to new government statistics. That's the first time since 1965 that homicide has not ranked as a major killer of American citizens.</p>
<p>The death rate fell the most from 2009 to 2010 for non-Latino black males with a nearly 2% decline in deaths. The death rate for non-Latino black females decreased 1.5%.</p>
<p>The preliminary homicide rate for 2010 was 5.2 deaths per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>Overall, life expectancy inched upward, from 78.6 in 2009 to 78.7 in 2010. Heart disease and cancer still account for about half of all deaths. HIV death rates fell 13.3% from 2009 to 2010. But the disease "remains a public health concern, especially for those between the ages of 15-64," the authors wrote.</p>
<p>Number 15 on the list -- pneumonitis -- refers to inflammation of the lungs caused by medications or other exposures, such as breathing something harmful over time. Death rates increased in 2010 for five conditions: Alzheimer's, kidney disease, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, Parkinson's and pneumonitis.</p>

<p>To aaaaaa5: I wonder what the list would look like if people ate responsibly, did not smoke, exercised regularly, and made sure their children followed that regimen.</p>

<p>This is good news? How could we allow homicide to be even in the top 100 causes for death in America. How is it that the most dangerous animal in the forest are our fellow human beings? One other major cause of death and permanent disability is automobile crashes. More than 40,000 Americans die every year on the highways. If we were to reduce the maximum speed to 30 miles per hour that would reduce deaths significantly and reduce our use of fuel significantly. However, we are in such a hurry that we are willing to sacrifice the lives of tens of thousands of our neighbors, friends, and relatives just so we can travel fast. One hundred fifty years ago if we were able to travel thirty miles in one day, we were happy. Now, we have to be able to move at 60 miles plus per hour to feel good. I consider every highway death that occurs at speeds above 30 miles per hour to be a form of murder. I live in Orange County about 90 miles from downtown San Diego and about 45 miles from downtown Los Angeles. At thirty miles per hour I should be able to get to Los Angeles in 90 miles and San Diego in three hours, oops that is about how long it takes me in normal conditions If we really want to save lives all we have to do is change our expectations about what is normal. Let's slow down and save lives. Are you with me?</p>

<p>I wonder what this list would look like if we had universal health coverage.</p>
