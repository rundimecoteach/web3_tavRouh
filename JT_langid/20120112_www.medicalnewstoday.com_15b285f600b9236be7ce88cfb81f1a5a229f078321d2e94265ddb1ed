<p>A pilot study reported online this week in the journal PLoS ONE reveals how scientists found evidence of potentially
dangerous viruses, including retroviruses and herpesviruses, in bushmeat and other wildlife products smuggled into the US. The
report authors say the study shows the importance of establishing proper surveillance and testing of imported wildlife products in
order to assess the potential risks they pose to public health.</p>
<p>The products had been confiscated at several US international airports, including John F. Kennedy International Airport, George
Bush Intercontinental-Houston and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International.</p>
<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) led the pilot study, with the collaboration of the American Museum of
Natural History, Columbia University, EcoHealth Alliance, the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, and the Wildlife
Conservation Society.</p>
<p>The authors note in their introduction that although we know that the global trade in wildlife has contributed to the emergence
and spread of many infectious diseases, and the US is the world's largest importer of wildlife and wildlife products, it has
"minimal pathogen surveillance", which makes it virtually impossible to assess the risks to public health posed by this
practice.</p>
