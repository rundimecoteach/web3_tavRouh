<p>A 36-year-old man has brought new meaning to the term "virgin birth" after revealing that he has fathered 14 children -- despite never having sex.</p>

<p>"I coined this term donor sexual and I'll explain, it means 100 percent of my sexual energy is for producing sperm for childless couples to have babies," Arsneault told host Anderson Cooper.</p>
<p>"It's a thrill," to meet her, he said. "I'm trying to not get too emotional. Iâ€™m just extremely happy that she's healthy and in a loving home. I hope she has the gene of compassion and that her parents nurture that."</p>
