<p>A midwife has been criticised by a coroner over the death of a Rotorua baby - and the baby's mother wants her licence revoked.</p>
<p>The midwife has admitted going against hospital policy and specialist advice.</p>
<p>Denise Simpson-Vogan held her only son Axton Tutahi Mead close to her and wept as she kissed him goodbye when he died a day after his birth.</p>
<p>Axton was not breathing when born at Rotorua Hospital on February 21, 2009 and died the next day at Waikato Hospital from perinatal asphyxia, with a haemorrhage on his brain and a background of foetal malnutrition.</p>
<p>Axton may have lived had his heart rate been monitored throughout labour, according to the coroner.</p>
<p>In his findings he stated Mrs Punita undertook refresher training in fetal monitoring immediately following the baby's death, her practice was reviewed by the New Zealand Midwifery Council and she had been counselled and attended workshops on documentation and infant resuscitation.</p>
<p>Dr Matenga said he was satisfied nothing more needed to be done.</p>
<p>Mrs Punita told an inquest into the baby's death that recordings from monitoring equipment, referred to as tracings, didn't show any distress.</p>
<p>Ms Simpson-Vogan agreed to talk because she said nobody should have to go through what she and her family had experienced.</p>
<p>"She shouldn't be delivering babies," she said of Mrs Punita. "The pain never goes away. We live with it every day."</p>
<p>Her first child, Shana, now 7, was born by Caesarean and the inquest into Axton's death heard that women who have had a Caesarean need to be monitored during subsequent labour in case their scar ruptures or the new baby gets distressed.</p>
<p>The decision to disconnect the monitor was crucial because tracings showed Axton's heart rate dropped considerably at least three times in the early stages of labour, Dr Matenga said.</p>
<p>The baby was born not breathing and with a haematoma on the top of his head with 30ml of blood in it after a 12-hour labour.</p>
<p>In evidence, Mrs Punita told the coroner she felt confident everything was normal but consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Sylivia Rosevear, who was asked to review the case, stated the death could have been avoided had monitoring been done throughout labour.</p>
