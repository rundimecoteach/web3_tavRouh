<p>He also reported that the proportion of men who had reported their drinking exceeded the recommended daily limits rose from 43% to 45% between 2003 and 2010 and, for women, fell from 37% to 33%.</p>
<p>Dr Burns also said there had been a "steady increase" in the number of overweight or obese adults between 1995 and 2010, with numbers in the 16-64 age group increasing from 52.4% to 63.3%.</p>
<p>In 2010, he added, 22% of adults met the recommended daily intake of five or more portions of fruit and vegetables - a figure which had "not changed significantly over time".</p>
<p>However, he also said death rates from the big three among under-75s has fallen by 28% - from 507 per 100,000 people in 1995 to 365 per 100,000 in 2009.</p>
<p>And smoking rates among 16 to 65-year-olds fell from 35% in 1995 to 28% in 2010.</p>
<p>Dr Burns welcomed the figures, but warned: "Not all sections of society are benefiting at the same rate and, overall, Scotland continues to have a higher level of ill health than most of our immediate neighbours in Europe."</p>
<p>The chief medical officer called for a change in dealing with problems, suggesting people and communities could get more involved, taking responsibility for health improvement beyond what it offered by the NHS.</p>
<p>He also said: "Health promotion campaigns usually have a positive effect on some people, but often those in most need of changing their behaviour are least likely to take notice of such campaigns."</p>
