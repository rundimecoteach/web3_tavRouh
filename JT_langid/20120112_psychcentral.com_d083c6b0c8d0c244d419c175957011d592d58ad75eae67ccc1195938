<p>The researchers used positron emission tomography, or PET imaging, to observe the immediate effects of alcohol in the brains of 13 heavy drinkers and 12 control subjects who were not heavy drinkers. In all of the subjects, alcohol intake led to a release of endorphins вЂ” and the more endorphins that were released in the nucleus accumbens, the greater the feelings of pleasure reported by each drinker.</p>
<p>The subjects were then each given a drink of alcohol, followed by a second injection of radioactive carfentanil, and scanned again with PET imaging. By comparing areas of radioactivity in the first and second PET images, the researchers were able to map the exact locations where endorphins were released in response to drinking.</p>
<p>The researchers found that endorphins released in response to drinking bind to a specific type of opioid receptor, the Mu receptor.</p>
