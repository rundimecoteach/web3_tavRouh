<p>Professor Norman Williams, president of the Royal College of Surgeons and Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, say 'urgent action' is needed to combat 'huge variations' in the quality and training of foreign doctors.</p>
<p>The issue resulted in tragic
consequences in 2008 when David Gray died after he was administered ten
times the required dose of the painkiller diamorphine by German locum Dr
Daniel Ubani on his first shift in the UK.</p>
<p>In a joint letter to the Daily
Telegraph, Dr Williams and Dr Thompson wrote:'The language competency of
doctors from the EU working in Britain, and the stifling effect of the
European Working Time Directive on the time that trainee doctors have to
learn on the job need urgent action.</p>
