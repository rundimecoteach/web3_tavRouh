<p>A broken blade in a jet engine has been determined as the cause of a crash in 2008 at 15 Wing Moose Jaw, home to one of the air force's flight training schools.</p>
<p>A student pilot and his instructor were in a Hawk trainer jet, when a blade in the engine broke.</p>
<p>That led to engine failure.</p>
<p>The two pilots ejected from the plane, which crashed a kilometre from the base.</p>
<p>The report also outlined some tense moments for the pilots when they had some trouble with their gear.</p>
<p>"Subsequent to the ejection and once under fully deployed parachutes, both pilots noted they were descending toward the burning field," the report said.</p>
<p>Neither of them, however, tried to steer away from the danger.</p>
<p>"Shortly after landing, the QFI [instructor] noticed the fire was rapidly approaching his position and he began to run away from the fire," the report said. "The QFI then stopped to look around for the student pilot.</p>
<p>"Upon locating him, the QFI observed the student pilot struggling to release the Quick Release Fitting (QRF) on his parachute harness," the report continued.</p>
<p>The student pilot’s parachute was on fire at this time.</p>
<p>The instructor ran to the student pilot to help out and the two of them were able to get away from the fire.</p>
<p>The report did not release further details of their injuries, but described them as serious.</p>
<p> The jet training is for NATO pilots.</p>
