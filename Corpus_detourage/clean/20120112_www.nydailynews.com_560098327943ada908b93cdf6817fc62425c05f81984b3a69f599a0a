<p>A study of bushmeat smuggled into the city shows it could spread disease or even spark pandemics, researchers said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Dr. Denise McAloose, chief pathologist for the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, said no one had tested illegal bushmeat for pathogens before the study.</p>
<p>Animal parts seized by custom agents at Kennedy Airport were routinely destroyed until the WCS partnered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2008 for the research.</p>
<p>"We wanted to know if in those confiscated materials there might be anything of significance, so we started looking," McAloose told the News.</p>
