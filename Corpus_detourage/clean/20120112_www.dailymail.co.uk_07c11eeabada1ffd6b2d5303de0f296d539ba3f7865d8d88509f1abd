<p>Happy deal: Michael Morpurgo said he was pleased nine million children would be reading his books through the promotion</p>
<p>Michael Morpurgo, the best-selling children’s author, is at the centre of a row over plans to give away millions of his books with McDonald’s Happy Meals.</p>
<p>The former children’s laureate, whose book War Horse has just been made into a blockbuster film by Steven Spielberg, is the figurehead of the fast-food promotion.</p>
<p>The deal, arranged by publisher HarperCollins and backed by the National Literacy Trust, will see McDonald's hand out nine million copies of Morpurgo's Mudpuddle Farm series.</p>
<p>In the past, McDonald's gave away toys, often linked to children’s films, to encourage children to eat its Happy Meals.</p>
<p>However, children’s food and health campaigners  accused the U.S. food chain of adopting a cynical marketing ploy.</p>
<p>They are questioning whether the tie-up with burgers, fries and chicken nuggets is the best way to get children reading.</p>
<p>Mr Morpurgo is something of a hero to the nation’s children. His books are hugely popular and he spends a lot of his time touring schools to encourage a love of reading.</p>

<p>The author is giving all royalties from the promotion to Farms for City children, a charity he set up with his wife in 1974.</p>
<p>He said: ‘I’m pleased that nine million children in Britain will be receiving copies of my books during this promotion.’</p>
<p>Charlie Powell, Campaigns Director of the Children's Food Campaign, was critical of McDonald’s, saying: ‘At a time when we have a childhood obesity epidemic this is clearly an inappropriate marketing strategy.</p>

<p>Mudpuddle promotion: Nine million of Morpurgo's series, aimed at younger readers, will be given away with Happy Meals</p>
<p>‘The idea appears to be designed to make fast food more attractive to children, which is not the direction we should be going in.’</p>
<p>He added: ‘You have to question whether it is McDonald’s role in society to improve childhood literacy.</p>
<p>‘This seems rather cynical to me. McDonald’s has been criticised in the past for using toys to promote Happy Meals, it seems they have moved to the next most acceptable thing, which is books for children.’</p>
<p>The McDonald’s Happy Meal promotion will include six titles from the Mudpuddle Farm series, aimed at younger readers: Mossop’s Last Chance; Albertine, Goose Queen; Pigs Might Fly!; Jigger’s Day Off; Martians at Mudpuddle Farm; Mum’s the Word. </p>
<p>Some nine million of the books, which will also be available to purchase at McDonald’s restaurants without the need to buy a meal, will be distributed.</p>
<p>McDonald's said the move was driven by research released by the National Literacy Trust in December which revealed that almost four million children in Britain – one in three – do not own a book.</p>
<p>Director of the Trust, Jonathan Douglas, said: ‘Our recent research showed that one in three children in this country don’t own a book, which is extremely concerning as there is a clear link between book ownership and children's future success in life. </p>
<p>High profile: Mr Morpurgo's book War Horse has just been adapted for the big screen by Hollywood legend Steven Spielberg</p>
<p>‘We are very supportive of McDonald’s decision to give families access to popular books, as its size and scale will be a huge leap towards encouraging more families to read together.’</p>
<p>Publisher at HarperCollins Children’s Books, Ann-Janine Murtagh, said: ‘We are delighted to be offering mums, dads and children the chance to enjoy books when they visit McDonald’s. </p>
