<p>Bored in the office? Research says workers often seek comfort in food, coffee and alcohol</p>
<p>Around half said being bored at work might lead them to look for a new job.</p>
<p>Dr Mann, of the University of Central Lancashire, said: 'My analysis suggests that the most significant cause of office boredom is an undemanding workload, so managers should look at ways of reducing sources of workplace boredom and encourage better ways of coping.</p>
<p>Internet addiction can be as harmful to teenagers' brains as cocaine and cannabisService with a smile hides misery of staff left feeling 'exhausted and cynical'</p>
<p>'This could involve enrichment programmes such as job rotation, multi-skilling and empowerment.</p>
<p>'Encouraging healthier ways of coping with boredom could include education or providing healthy snacks and drinks in canteens.'</p>
<p>People who are bored at work are more likely to have an alcoholic drink at the end of the day, a study said</p>
<p>The study, among more than 100 office workers, also found that some people are more prone to boredom.</p>
<p>The research will be presented to the British Psychological Society's annual occupational psychology conference in Chester today.</p>
