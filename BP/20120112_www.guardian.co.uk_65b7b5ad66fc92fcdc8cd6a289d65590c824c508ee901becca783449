Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian</DIV></DIV><DIV id="article-body-blocks"><P>Patients' safety is being put at risk because trainee <A href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/doctors" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Doctors">doctors</A> in the UK are not getting enough on-the-job experience, leading doctors have warned.</P><P>The &quot;stifling effect&quot; of the <A href="http://" title="">European working time directive</A> is limiting the hours they work so much that the standards reached by future medical and surgical consultants is being undermined, according to Norman Williams, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, and Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians.</P><P>In a letter to the <A href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/9008920/Patients-at-risk.html" title="">Daily Telegraph</A>, they also highlight concerns about variations in training requirements in different EU member states and the language skills of some doctors.</P><P>&quot;It is also essential to ensure that doctors are competent,&quot; they say. &quot;But the existing EU legal framework fails to recognise that periodic revalidation and requirements to participate in continuing professional development vary significantly across member states.</P><P>&quot;The increased mobility of health professionals in the EU has highlighted huge variations both in the practical abilities of professionals of similar grades, and in the systems set up to ensure quality, in different member states.&quot;</P><P>The doctors' letter adds: &quot;We continue to be concerned about the future of medical training – acute medical training, in particular – and the effect of the European working time directive on acute medical and surgical trainees, which reduces the number of hours available for them to train. We call for flexibility at a European and a national level with regard to how on-call time and compensatory rest for trainees are calculated.&quot;</P><P>The letter is likely to infuriate the European commission, which is <A href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/dec/20/eu-doctors-rules-gmc-tests" title="">already proposing some changes to the rules governing free movement of labour</A> within the EU, partly in response to the storm that followed the Guardian's revelations of similar concerns over <A href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/aug/23/rules-eu-doctors-medical-risk" title="">patient safety raised by medical regulators and GPs in 2009.</A></P><P>But many professional bodies in the UK do not think these go far enough. Before Christmas, the General Medical Council (GMC), the regulator for doctors, warned that EU doctors would still be able to register in the UK without being tested on their English or medical competence.</P><P>The health secretary, Andrew Lansley, is strengthening the powers of <A href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/nhs" title="More from guardian.co.uk on NHS">NHS</A> employers to check on medics' language skills under measures not bound by EU laws, but the GMC warned it would first have to recognise doctors' qualifications without giving them the same checks that were applied when doctors from other parts of the world sought work.</P><P>The commission says that existing EU rules, including on language skills, were agreed by all member states and, if applied correctly, protect patients and do not endanger their safety. Problems in some member states have been, or are being, rectified by national systems without changes to EU law, it says.</P><P>However, the commission recognises the need to &quot;clarify and slightly amend&quot; some aspects of EU rules and is now doing so.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
