Except for the elderly, young children or those with severe medical issues, the virus usually is harmless. Over the past few years, cruise lines have a well-established protocol for dealing with cases of noro-virus onboard ships.</P><P>Health groups, such as the <STRONG>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</STRONG> and <STRONG>Britain</STRONG>'s <STRONG>Health Protection Agency</STRONG>, generally encourage ports to offer support to vessels arriving with ill people. In addition, only 74 passengers and crew (about two percent of those on board) had been reported ill; that's below the three percent level the CDC considers as an outbreak. The Falklands' chief medical officer made the decision after consulting with a U.K. microbiologist. </P><P>&quot;An outbreak in the Falkland Islands would put enormous pressure on our limited medical resources, and jeopardize other scheduled cruise visits,” a government statement said.

Argentina calls the Falklands by a different name, the <STRONG>Malvinas</STRONG>. The two countries went briefly to war over the islands in 1982, with the British maintaining control.
