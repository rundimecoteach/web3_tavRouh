The average survival rate has increased, however.</P><P>The report also shows the four most common cancers diagnosed in the city — female breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer — are not unlike most other areas. But Ottawa does have a lower rate of both prostate and cervical cancer diagnoses than the rest of Ontario.</P><P>For men, the most common cancers were prostate, colorectal, lung and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The most deadly of male cancers were lung, colorectal, prostate and pancreatic cancers.</P><P>For women, cancer was most prevalent in the breast, lung, colon and body of the uterus. The most deadly were lung, breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers.</P><P>Overall, survival rates have increased in the city between five-year periods of 1993-1997 and 2003-2007.</P><P>The data is about five years old so the report warns the information &quot;may not be a truly representative picture of the current burden of cancer in Ottawa.&quot;</P><P>You can read the <A href="http://ottawa.ca/calendar/ottawa/citycouncil/obh/2012/01-16/5863_OPH_Cancer_Report_Eng_PRESS_Jan_4-12.pdf" target="_blank">full report here</A>, which will be presented to the Ottawa Board of Health on Jan. 16.</P></DIV><DIV id="storytools" class="wrap8 clearfix sclt-share"><H3 class="metanav">Share Tools</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
