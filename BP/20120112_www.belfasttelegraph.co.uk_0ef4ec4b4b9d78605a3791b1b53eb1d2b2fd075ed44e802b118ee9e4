After Belfast model Gemma Garrett found out she was among thousands who had 
  faulty breast implants, her advice now to women is to be happy with what 
  nature provided. 

</P><P>
Gemma Garrett is angry and it’s not difficult to understand why. Still healing 
  eight months after surgery to remove ruptured PIP breast implants, the 
  30-year-old Belfast model has no idea if there is a lasting risk to her 
  health. 
</P><P>
It doesn’t help that Gemma now believes she was wrongly advised to have 
  implants in the first place and that there were other less invasive medical 
  options open to her. 
</P><P>
And she claims that the surgeon she consulted and who performed the operation 
  — and who now won’t return her calls — should have informed her that he was 
  using the cheaper option of Poly Implant Prothese implants — the current 
  cause of a huge global health scare. 
</P><P>
But most of all she is angry at herself — for being too trusting of a medical 
  professional and for not carrying out more thorough research before opting 
  to follow his advice. 
</P><P>
Determined to channel the strong emotion which has followed her horrific 
  ordeal into something positive Gemma has launched a personal crusade to 
  persuade young girls against having a breast enlargement. 
</P><P>
She says: “I’ve learnt a very hard lesson. 
</P><P>“Fortunately I am healthy at the minute and I can only hope there are no 
  lasting effects but no one can tell me for sure. 
</P><P>“I think big boobs are overrated and it horrifies me how many young girls at 
  just 17 and 18 years old are making the decision, supported by parents, to 
  have breast implants. 
</P><P>“In many cases their breasts haven’t even finished growing. I want to campaign 
  to warn them that it is not as glamorous as they think and that they will 
  have to find the money to go through surgery all over again after 10 years, 
  something else which I wasn’t told.”</P><P>
Gemma, a former Miss Great Britain had surgery in 2008, not because she wanted 
  to be a larger cup size but because she was self conscious that one of her 
  breasts was bigger than the other. 
</P><P>
Working as a model at the time made her even more aware of the difference and 
  she decided to seek the advice of a breast surgeon to see if she could have 
  corrective surgery. 
</P><P>“I didn’t want larger boobs. I was a size 8-10 at the time and my breasts were 
  a full C cup or even a D cup which I was happy with,” she says. 
</P><P>
Gemma went online to research breast surgeons and in the end opted for a 
  London consultant who had been recommended by model friends in the city. 
</P><P>
He recommended breast implants to correct the size variance in her breasts 
  although Gemma later discovered there were corrective surgery options open 
  to her which he didn’t mention. 
</P><P>
At £5,000, the cost of the surgery was more than double what many other places 
  were charging but this only served to reassure Gemma that she was paying for 
  the best. 
</P><P>
She says: “I had just got my first big modeling pay cheque and even though I 
  could have got it done a lot cheaper elsewhere I thought I was paying more 
  because it was the best hospital and the best surgeon and that actually gave 
  me confidence about it.”</P><P>
Gemma was told her implants would be silicone but PIP was not mentioned. 
</P><P>
It has since emerged that the controversial implants which originated in 
  France are filled with industrial chemicals including those used as fuel 
  additives or for the manufacture of industrial rubber tubing. 
</P><P>
It was last spring when Gemma discovered one of her breasts had become lumpy 
  and decided to visit her GP who advised that she contact her implant 
  surgeon. 
</P><P>
After several unsuccessful attempts to get in touch with him an increasingly 
  worried Gemma made an appointment with another specialist at a clinic in 
  London’s Harley Street to have her breasts examined. 
</P><P>
She says: “As well as the lumps I had been feeling quite tired and drained 
  even though I was very active. 
</P><P>“When I went to Harley Street the consultant warned me that my implants could 
  be PIP and his advice was that I get them out straight away. 
</P><P>“I was really, really scared, and the truth is, I still am. I didn’t know the 
  lasting effects and I’m angry about that. 
</P><P>“I had to wait two weeks for surgery and it was like hell because I just 
  wanted them out. 
</P><P>“I had heard about PIP implants as there had been a wee bit of press on them 
  but nothing like the scandal there is now. It was enough to worry me though. 
  The operation itself was major and when I came round the surgeon was shaking 
  his head and saying: ‘I can’t believe they did this to you’. 
</P><P>“He said he had done what he could, but some silicone had fused into my 
  breast. 
</P><P>“I felt a million times better as soon as they were taken out. I was left with 
  huge cavities where the implants were. 
</P><P>“Every six weeks, I go to hospital, have a needle inserted and the blood which 
  has filled the cavities drained. It’s painful and unpleasant. I’m told the 
  cavities will close eventually. 
</P><P>“It’s pretty disgusting but I think it is important to talk about it to show 
  young people the less glamorous side to it.”</P><P>
Gemma’s operation cost her £11,000 and she feels fortunate that she could 
  afford to pay for it. 
</P><P>
Her breasts are scarred but are still healing and she has been assured that 
  any permanent scarring will be minimal. 
</P><P>
She feels strongly that all women with PIP implants should have them removed 
  and believes both the Government and the breast clinics should provide 
  financial support for those who can’t afford it. 
</P><P>
The French Government is to pay for 30,000 women with the implants to have 
  them removed. 
</P><P>
But the UK Government has played down any health fears for the 40,000 women in 
  the UK believed to have had the surgery. 
</P><P>
She says: “It is scary that they are telling people not to worry about it if 
  it hasn't opened up. 
</P><P>“I think if you have PIPs, or are in any doubt that you may have them, then 
  you need to get them taken out. 
</P><P>“It makes me angry that the French who made them are saying they have to be 
  taken out and yet the British Government is not 
</P><P>“Ultimately I think the surgeons are responsible as they bought in these cheap 
  products. 
</P><P>“It has been said that women have got themselves into this sittuation because 
  of vanity but I would say to that, ‘what about smokers who get lung cancer 
  or sun worshippers who get skin cancer’? They know the risks, these women 
  didn’t. 
</P><P>“The Government can’t just leave them with the risk of these things leaking 
  into their systems. 
</P><P>“And the women shouldn’t have to pay as that means the clinics that caused the 
  problem in the first place are getting even more money for the mistake they 
  made.”</P><P><B>more than nature intended
