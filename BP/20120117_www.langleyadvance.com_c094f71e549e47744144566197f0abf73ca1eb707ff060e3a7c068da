But, hey! No matter who says it, there is nothing more musical to the ears of a crusty old newspaper editor than to hear that there's nothing worse than him.</P><P>Yep. I am a reformed smoker. I gave up the evil weed 36 years ago. That's about a half-dozen years before I</P><P>could have taken advantage of the moral support of National Non-Smoking Week. which is this week, for the 30th time.</P><P>When I stopped smoking - after several tries, some lasting a couple of months or more - I relied on the help of a girlfriend.</P><P>She told me something had to go: either the smokes, or her.</P><P>I dumped the habit, and two weeks later, she dumped me - and there was no way I was ever going to give her the satisfaction of seeing me with a cigarette hanging from my mouth after that.</P><P>Kicking the cancer sticks works differently for different people.</P><P>It's seldom easy. At 2: 30 in the afternoon on Feb. 4, 1976, I tossed into the nearest garbage can a pack that still had six cigarettes in it.</P><P>(A friend fished them out, asking if I minded if he took them. I said, &quot;No, go ahead, catch cancer, if you like.&quot; He said, &quot;Anyone can quit smoking; it takes a MAN to face cancer.&quot;)</P><P>I attribute my success in stopping (not &quot;quitting&quot;: you can't quit, you can only stop, and hope it never catches you back) to two things.</P><P>First was my pride. As I noted above, I wasn't going to let my &quot;ex&quot; think I was too weak to stay off the cancer sticks without her. Second was tossing those six smokes in the trash. All my earlier attempts started with me saying, &quot;As soon as this pack is finished.&quot;</P><P>Chucking those six valuable cigarettes constituted a commitment.</P><P>No, three things: Third was the escalating cost of cigarettes. Within a couple of days of my last smoke, the price had escalated to a whopping 65 cents for a pack of 20 - three quarters (an astounding 75 cents) to buy them from a vending machine. speaking of which, whatever happened to those vending machines that were absolutely everywhere? As I had been smoking a pack and a half a day (which increased every time I started up again after &quot;quitting&quot;), that was turning into serious bread for a university student.</P><P>No, four things:</P><P>Fourth was my dad's pride. He was so obviously, incredibly proud of me for breaking the habit, that I couldn't have had the heart to let him down.</P><P>As a smoker himself, he knew how difficult stopping can be.</P><P>I know some smokers will go &quot;Aha! Your dad's a smoker, and you've said he's now 97 years old! How unhealthy can it be, after all, eh?&quot;</P><P>Sorry to rain on your smoke, folks, but apart from there being occasional anomalies to the statistical reality, dad's another of us ex-smokers. He quit - and there's a hilarious story to go with that, for another day - way back in the 1960s.</P><P>And there's a fifth thing that kept me from starting up again, despite the intense cravings (and nightmares on the eve of each anniversary of my success since then, nightmares in which I discover that I've been sneaking puffs all along). It took about six months to really notice the change. but my general health had improved dramatically.</P><P>Now there is a lot more help for those who want to stop smoking than there was (here comes the old man line!). back in my day.</P><P>See provincially subsidized options at www. health.gov.bc.ca/pharmacare/stop-smoking.</P><P>editor@langleyadvance.com</P><DIV class="copyright">Â© Copyright (c) Langley Advance</DIV></DIV><DIV class="clear">Â </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
