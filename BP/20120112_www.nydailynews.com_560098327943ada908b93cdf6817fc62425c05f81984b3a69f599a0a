	A study of bushmeat smuggled into the city shows it could spread disease or even spark pandemics, researchers said Tuesday.</P><P><A title="Denise McAloose" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Denise+McAloose">Dr. Denise McAloose</A>, chief pathologist for the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, said no one had tested illegal bushmeat for pathogens before the study.</P><P>
	Animal parts seized by custom agents at Kennedy Airport were routinely destroyed until the WCS partnered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2008 for the research.</P><P>&quot;We wanted to know if in those confiscated materials there might be anything of significance, so we started looking,&quot; McAloose told the News.</P><P>
	In 2010, the pilot program expanded to airports servicing Philadelphia, Houston, Atlanta and Washington D.C.</P><P>
	Scientists found simian foamy viruses and two types of herpesviruses in the animal parts tested.</P><P>
	While the herpesviruses detected are not considered dangerous to people, related viruses cause disease in humans.</P><P>
	Researchers say the results show potential danger.</P><P>
	â€œDiseases such as HIV, Ebola, swine flu, avian flu and monkey pox all originated in wildlife,&quot; McAloose said. &quot;We don't know where the next disease like that might occur.&quot;</P><P>
	Some animal skulls, hands, arms and torsos were still fresh in coolers when confiscated. Others were long dead and dried out.</P><P>
	Tissue from the freshest part each animal, including raw or red muscle, joint fluid or bone marrow, was preserved in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C.</P><P>
	Scientists from WCS and the American Museum of Natural History used advanced genetic barcoding technology to identify each animal species.</P><P>
	The 25 primates tested included baboons, mangabeys, guenons, green monkeys and endangered chimpanzees. They also identified 35 rats.</P><P>
	The study is ongoing, and straw bats that were recently seized at JFK will be analyzed during the next phase.</P><P>
	Tissues were tested for pathogens at CDC and Columbia University labs.</P><P>
	Three-fourths of emerging infectious diseases in humans originate from contact with wildlife, and researchers fear the wildlife trade could spur new pandemics.</P><P>&quot;Every point along the trade route, from the hunter to the seller to the shipper, has the potential to be exposed to whatever that animal was carrying,&quot; said McAloose.</P><P>
	Researchers are calling for more education about the dangers of wildlife trading and harsher penalties for illegal activity.</P><P>
