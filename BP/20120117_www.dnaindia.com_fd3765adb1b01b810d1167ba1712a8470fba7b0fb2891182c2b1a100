Half were given two small bars of flavonoid-enriched chocolate each day and half were given placebo chocolate bars. </P><P>Those receiving extra flavonoids reduced the risk of a heart attack by 3.4 per cent.</P><P>Their insulin resistance and cholesterol levels were significantly reduced by the flavonoids. </P><P>“These results are significant because they provide further concrete evidence that diet has a beneficial clinical effect over and above conventional drug treatment,” the Daily Express quoted Professor Aedin Cassidy, of Norwich Medical School, as saying.</P><P>The researchers say further research is needed to examine if similar effects are seen in men with Type 2 diabetes.</P><P>The findings have been published in the journal Diabetes Care. </P></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
