Vibra had been running the rehab units at Summa’s City, Barberton and Wadsworth- Rittman hospitals since 2009.</P><P>Summa is the majority owner, with a 52 percent stake in the hospital. The joint venture is leasing the facility from Summa, which obtained financing for the project.</P><P>The new hospital has about 200 employees.</P><P>The facility allows Summa to consolidate rehabilitation units at City, Barberton and Wadsworth-Rittman hospitals into one building that is dedicated to caring for patients who need rehabilitation services.</P><P>“We could design this building specifically for rehab,” said Dr. Jeffrey Sanderson, the hospital’s medical director. “You just can’t beat it when you have one mission.”</P><P>Special design</P><P>As a result, he said, everything in the building is designed with the needs of patients who need rehabilitation in mind.</P><P>For example, the floor is made with a wood pattern that helps patients with balance issues easily navigate the hallways.</P><P>An outdoor area with sidewalks, uneven pavement, rocks, grass, ramps and curbs helps them practice getting around in the real world after discharge. There also is  a car transfer simulator.</P><P>The rehabilitation units at Barberton and Wadsworth-Rittman closed last month. The City Hospital unit will remain open until patients can be transferred to the new hospital.</P><P>Together, the three hospitals had 42 rehab beds, 18 fewer than the new facility has.</P><P>“We’re increasing access,” Henthorn said.</P><P>The Summa Rehab Hospital is the second free-standing rehabilitation hospital in the Akron area.</P><P>Summa’s rival, Akron General Health System, owns and operates the Edwin Shaw Rehabilitation Institute in Cuyahoga Falls.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
