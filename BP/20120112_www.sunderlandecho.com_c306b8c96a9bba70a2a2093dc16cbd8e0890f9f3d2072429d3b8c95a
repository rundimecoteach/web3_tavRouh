If more expensive implants were used I wouldn’t have to go through major surgery again, take time off from work and have the inconvenience of not being able to do things with my kids for a while.”</P><P>Though Sharon, of Pitcairn Road, had been experiencing pain, she didn’t begin to panic until she received a letter in 2010 stating that she had been fitted with a sub-standard implant.</P><P>She has since learnt that she is on a national database of women who have had the controversial French-made PIP implant and is awaiting a date for her replacement surgery at Sunderland Royal Hospital.</P><P>On Friday, the Government announced that anxious patients who had their surgery on the NHS will be able to have the implants removed and replaced free of charge.</P><P>Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said he expects private clinics to offer the same deal to their patients.

I was on antidepressants because of it.</P><P>“When I started getting pains a couple of years ago I thought it might be because of my age. Then in 2010 I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of rheumatoid arthritis.</P><P>“Doctors say there’s no link between that and the rupture but on the internet there are various studies about the link between the condition and silicone leaking into your body.”</P><P>She added: “I’m part of a support group and women have all had different experiences. Some of the women who had their operations privately are having to pay for the replacement surgery.</P><P>“But this isn’t cosmetic surgery, it’s corrective surgery for something which shouldn’t have been done in the first place.”</P><P>Around 40,000 British women have received PIP implants manufactured by the now closed French company Poly Implant Prostheses (PIP).</P><P>Although there is no evidence to support the routine removal of the implants, Government experts concluded that it cannot be ruled out that some of the implants are toxic.</P><P>The expert review panel also said the anxiety caused to women is a health condition in itself.</P><P>In France, the government has told 30,000 women they should have the implants removed while the Czech and German authorities have recommended that women should also have them taken out.</P><P>Twitter: @sunechokaty</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
