Scientists have discovered a sixth basic taste that the human tongue can 
  detect – fat.

For generations, scientists thought the human tongue could detect only four 
  basic tastes: sweet, sour, salt and bitter. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="secondPar"><P>
Then a fifth was discovered, &quot;<A href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/7195114/Umami-in-a-tube-fifth-taste-goes-on-sale-in-supermarkets.html">umami</A>&quot; 
  or savoury. Now, researchers have identified a previously-unrecognised &quot;sixth 
  taste&quot; – fat. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="thirdPar"><P>
A team in the United States has located a chemical receptor in the taste buds 
  on the tongue that recognises fat molecules, and found that its sensitivity 
  varies between individuals. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="fourthPar"><P>
The finding may help to explain why some people consume more fatty foods, as 
  they are less aware of the taste as they eat. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="fifthPar"><P>
The researchers hope their discovery can be exploited to combat obesity by 
  increasing people's sensitivity to fat in their food.

Apart from the basic tastes, other aspects of food flavour actually come from 
  the smell and are detected in the nose. 
</P><P>
The research team, from the school of medicine at Washington University, St 
  Louis, showed that people with more of a receptor called CD36 were better at 
  detecting the presence of fat in food. 
</P><P>
They found that variations in a gene that produces CD36 makes people more or 
  less sensitive to the presence of fat. 
</P><P>
 &quot;The ultimate goal is to understand how our perception of fat in food 
  might influence what foods we eat and the qualities of fat that we consume,&quot; 
  said Professor Nada Abumrad, who led the research. 
</P><P>
 &quot;We've found one potential reason for individual variability in how 
  people sense fat. What we will need to determine in the future is whether 
  our ability to detect fat in foods influences our fat intake, which clearly 
  would have an impact on obesity.&quot; 
</P><P>
The study, which is published in the Journal of Lipid Research, found that 
  those with half as much CD36 were eight times less sensitive to the presence 
  of fat. 
</P><P>
Up to 20 per cent of people are believed to have a variant of the CD36 gene 
  that is associated with producing lower levels of the receptor, which could 
  mean they are less sensitive to the presence of fat in food. This may make 
  them more prone to obesity. 
</P><P>
Dr Yanina Pepino, who also conducted the research, added: &quot;If we follow 
  the results in animals, a high-fat diet would lead to less production of 
  CD36, and that, in turn, could make a person less sensitive to fat. 
</P><P>
 &quot;From our results in this study, we would hypothesise that people with 
  obesity may make less of the CD36 protein. 
</P><P>
 &quot;So it would seem logical that the amounts of the protein we make can be 
  modified, both by a person's genetics and by the diet they eat.&quot;
