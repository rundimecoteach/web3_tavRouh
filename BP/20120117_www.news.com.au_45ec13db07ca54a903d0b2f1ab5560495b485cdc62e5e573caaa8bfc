So I don't have other activity outside of that.&quot;</P><P>An incredulous Mr Cooper asked: &quot;So you do not have sex?&quot;</P><P>&quot;I will probably be the 40-year-old virgin,&quot; the donor explained. &quot;Except I'll have 15 plus kids&quot; - a statement that drew applause from the audience, to the confusion of the host.</P><P>The show saw the virgin dad meet one of his progeny for the first time as Analise, who turns two this week, walked onto the stage.</P><P>A visibly emotional Mr Arsenault said the meeting was a &quot;a thrill&quot;. The toddler is mothered by a lesbian couple who seemed overjoyed following the donor's decision to help them conceive.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
