Good food hygiene means a good rating, which is good for business.</P><P>“Professor Hugh Pennington, who chaired the public inquiry into the 2005 E.coli outbreak supports such a scheme as an inexpensive way of driving significant improvements in food safety.”</P><P>Food business, including restaurants, takeaways, school and hospital canteens, are awarded a food hygiene rating of between zero and five based on their regular environmental health inspections.</P><P>A rating of zero means urgent improvement is necessary; a five means a business has very good hygiene standards.</P><P>The ratings were launched in October 2010 and are available online. Some businesses, usually those with a rating of three (generally satisfactory) or more, chose to display their ratings on their premises.</P><P>Under the proposals, businesses which do not display their hygiene rating could be hit with a £200 fixed penalty notice fine and a maximum fine of £1,000 if prosecuted.</P><P>The consultation document, which is published today, says the mandatory scheme would apply to all places where people eat out and where they buy their food from, including supermarkets, delicatessens and bakeries.</P><P>It is thought 30,000 businesses in Wales would be covered by the scheme. Currently more than 13,500 have been rated under the voluntary scheme operated by the Food Standards Agency.</P><P>Julie Barratt, director of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health in Wales, said: “We think this is a marvellous idea and believe it is important for the public to be able to make informed choices about where they eat.</P><P>“The publication of a hygiene score on the door means people can make appropriate choices and it will also drive up standards – if a one-rated business is next door to a five-rated business, the public will chose the five, meaning the other will have to up its game.”</P><P>Maria Battle, senior director of Consumer Focus Wales, which has campaigned for a mandatory scheme, said: “The overwhelming majority of people in Wales have told us they want a simple and transparent food hygiene standards system with mandatory display of food hygiene ratings.</P><P>“They also said they want to be able to download inspection reports from the food hygiene rating scheme website, while more than half of people told us they want to simply pick up the phone or write to their local council to obtain the information.</P><P>“We’re pleased a question on the public availability of inspection reports has been asked as part of the consultation.</P><P>“We also welcome on-the-spot penalties to deal with any food businesses that are unhappy about displaying poor ratings on their premises. Similar schemes that ran in New York and Toronto have been successful and helped to deter businesses from non-display in the first place and drove up standards.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></TM:CONTENTOBJECT></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
