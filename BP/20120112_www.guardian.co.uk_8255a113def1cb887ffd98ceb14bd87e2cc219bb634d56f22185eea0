The highest-earning firms were: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) (£1.61m), KPMG (£1.47m) and McKinsey &amp; Co (£1.27m). Ernst &amp; Young earned the least, at £332.650.</P><P>The biggest individual contracts awarded PWC £852,875 for its work with six clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in outer north-east London, and McKinsey £736,500 for passing on skills to personnel in five CCGs in inner north-east London, the document reveals.</P><P>The issue of management consultants being paid to advise the NHS has become politically charged since Andrew Lansley, a fierce critic of those arrangements, made a crackdown on such contracts one of his first major decisions after becoming health secretary in May 2010, and because of the NHS's ongoing financial squeeze.</P><P>Eight firms are advising 38 GP-led CCGs that have been set up across London and which will replace PCTs in April 2013 and take responsibility for patient treatment budgets worth billions of pounds. They are ensuring CCGs &quot;have the business management and leadership expertise need to manage health budgets and meet the health needs of Londoners, working with their partners such as social services&quot;, said NHS London.</P><P>&quot;It was decided just to use external organisations for this. The eight firms chosen are in a roster to help CCGs prepare for the new [NHS] era. They are, in effect, preferred suppliers. We want CCGs to learn how to manage budgets so that, when PCTs have ceased to exist [in 2013], CCGs are up to speed as organisations in their own right and ready to take on their new responsibilities,&quot; said an NHS London spokesman.</P><P>Private firms were offered the work partly because of concern that PCTs across the capital would not be able to do it after losing up to 2,000 managers during 2010-11 as part of an NHS-wide drive to reduce management posts, he added.</P><P>Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, said the fact that only private firms had been selected to carry out the work in the £7m contract was a sign of how the revamped NHS would work.</P><P>&quot;The prime minister has to justify spending this amount of NHS money on private firms at a time of great financial challenge. The government is already wasting £3.45bn on a reckless and unnecessary reorganisation of the NHS and this forced use of private firms is a worrying sign of things to come,&quot; said Burnham.</P><P>NHS London said the £7m represented just 0.6% of its total £1.2bn annual &quot;multi-professional education and training budget&quot;, which is used for training clinicians, including GPs, and did not affect the delivery of frontline NHS service.</P><P>&quot;Developing highly effective clinical commissioning groups is a big challenge in a relatively short space of time. Calling on external expertise will give CCGs the intensive support they need, while helping London's NHS keep a tight grip on performance in the interim,&quot; said an NHS London spokesman.</P><P>The Royal College of GPs' Centre for Commissioning has allied itself with McKinsey over teaching family doctors, even though the college has fiercely opposed Lansley's radical restructure of the NHS.</P><P>A college spokeswoman said: &quot;The RCGP is working with a number of organisations, including McKinsey, to ensure quality commissioning skills can be provided to GPs and other healthcare professionals who are keen to embrace a commissioning role. The college has been involved in providing expertise to support commissioning, including training.&quot;</P><P>The Department of Health backed NHS London. &quot;Putting NHS doctors in charge of their own services means they need the right skills and training to manage taxpayer's money responsibly. But in making arrangements for that training we would always urge the NHS to make sure funds were being spent as effectively as possible&quot;, said a spokeswoman.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
