		Bhubaneswar, Jan 12 (PTI) In a bid to check spread of
bird flu, Odisha government today began culling of fowls
within three km radius of Keranga in Khurda district as
advised by the Centre.
	&quot;The culling of poultry has been launched at a private
firm in Keranga and nearby areas,&quot; Sanjeet Kumar, central
government's Nodal Officer for culling, said while
supervising the operation in the field.
	While one team had been pressed into service for culling
work at the private firm having about 28,000 poultry, another
group was busy in nearby villages.
	Stressing that the entire operation was undertaken with
adequate precaution and safeguards, Kumar said two 12-feet
deep pits have been dug to bury the culled birds.
	The decision to undertake culling was taken following an
advisory from the Centre after re-examination of serum of
some infected poultry in Keranga area. Earlier, tests
confirmed trace of H5N1 virus in two dead birds.
	Though locals initially protested the slight delay in
starting the culling, work later progressed in full swing.
District Collector Roopa Mishra also visited the area to
monitor the culling, official sources said.
	While culling was on in three km radius of Keranga,
surveillance work was undertaken in villages within its ten km
radius to detect any possible outbreak of avian influenza,
Gopal Tripathy, Odisha's Nodal Officer in Fisheries and Animal
Resource Development department, said.
	Besides the commercial firm having about 28,000 fowls,
culling of other poultry stock was also carried out in the
area, Tripathy said.
	The department had trained about 120 personnel, including
50 veterinary doctors, to undertake culling.
	The state government has also stopped serving eggs in the
mid-day meal of schools in the affected areas of Keranga and
16 other adjacent villages.
