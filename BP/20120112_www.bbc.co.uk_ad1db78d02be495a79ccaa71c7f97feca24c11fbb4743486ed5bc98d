Much of this is perfectly legal and supplies the pet industry. Nonetheless, these animals also require improved pathogen surveillance, say the researchers.</P><P>&quot;Exotic wildlife pets and bushmeat are Trojan horses that threaten humankind at sites where they are collected in the developing world as well as the US. Our study underscores the importance of surveillance at ports, but we must also encourage efforts to reduce demand for products that drive the wildlife trade,&quot; said Ian Lipkin of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.</P><P>One key aspect of concern highlighted by the team was the identification in the samples of some endangered species, including the Guinea baboon and the sooty mangabey, an Old World monkey.</P><P>Marcus Rowcliffe, from the Institute of Zoology in London, UK, and who was not connected with the research, commented: &quot;The extent to which an intercontinental luxury meat market may be developing is of major concern, because if that is happening it could have very worrying impacts on wild populations.</P><P>&quot;This whole area is marked by a lot of unknowns which is why we need more studies like this.&quot;</P></DIV><DIV><DIV class="story-related"><H2>More on This Story</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
