Claire Wang, MD, ScD, of Columbia University in New York City, and colleagues.</P><P>Although those numbers may seem inconsequential, over 10 years the result would be 2.4 million fewer person-years of diabetes, 95,000 fewer cases of coronary heart disease, 26,000 fewer deaths, and a health-related cost savings of $17 billion, the researchers reported.</P><P>Moreover, the tax could be expected to generate some $13 billion in revenue, they observed.</P><P>Given the &quot;monumental role&quot; of increased taxes on reducing tobacco consumption, Wang and colleagues constructed a model in which they calculated the projected impact of a penny-per-ounce excise tax on sugar-sweetened drinks among U.S. adults.</P><P>They estimated that this tax would result in a 15% decrease (95% CI 6 to 24) in consumption of sweetened beverages by adults ages 25 to 64.</P><P>The effects would be particularly striking in men. The projected 1.3 lb average weight loss for those ages 25 to 44 would be associated with a 3.4% decrease in diabetes, 22,000 fewer cases of coronary heart disease, and 4,000 fewer premature deaths. For men ages 45 to 64, a weight loss of only 0.7 lb could result in a 2.3% decrease in diabetes, 54,000 fewer cases of heart disease, and 15,000 fewer deaths.</P><P>The researchers noted that their model is based on certain assumptions, such as that a 10% increase in the cost of sugary drinks would be associated with an 8% reduction in consumption, and uncertainty as to whether people would substitute other sweetened foods.</P><P>They also acknowledged the likelihood of pushback by the soft drink industry, as happened when New York State attempted to impose this type of tax.</P><P>The two other studies looked more closely at interventions specifically targeting diabetes.</P><P>In one, Xiaohui Zhuo, PhD, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and colleagues, estimated that implementation of a nationwide community-based program could delay or prevent almost 900,000 cases of diabetes over 25 years, at a savings of $5.7 billion.</P><P>Zhuo and colleagues used a simulation model to determine the outcomes if a program based on the Diabetes Prevention Program clinical trial could be extended to include screening for all adults ages 18 to 84, with a lifestyle intervention for those found to be at risk.</P><P>The intervention consisted of 16 group sessions during the first year and eight the second year, the goal being a loss of 5% to 7% of body weight.</P><P>The researchers estimated that this intervention would lead to a 40% reduction in risk for diabetes during those two years and a 10% reduction each year thereafter.</P><P>The result of the intervention over a period of 25 years was a gain of 952,000 years of life and 669,000 quality-adjusted life-years, at a total cost of $24.1 billion.</P><P>But there also would be a $29.8 billion long-term saving in costs for treatment of the 885,000 people who would have developed diabetes and its complications, for an overall saving of $5.7 billion.</P><P>The researchers acknowledged that employers might be unwilling to take on the insurance burden to implement the program. &quot;In the context of the current U.S. reimbursement system, it might be necessary for all health insurers to participate and share prevention costs if implementation were to be successful,&quot; wrote Zhuo and colleagues.</P><P>The third report was a meta-analysis of studies that looked at outcomes for the Diabetes Prevention Program.</P><P>&quot;The Diabetes Prevention Program trial established that weight loss was the single most important factor in reducing diabetes incidence  --  for every kilogram of weight loss, diabetes incidence was reduced by 16%,&quot; wrote Mohammed K. Ali, MBChB, and colleagues from Emory University in Atlanta.</P><P>However, the intervention in that trial was costly, and a number of subsequent studies have examined lower cost approaches adapted from the original intervention.</P><P>The 28 studies analyzed by Ali's group included 2,916 participants who averaged 55 years of age and whose mean body mass index was 34.</P><P>The majority were white women.</P><P>At one year, the mean weight loss was −3.99% of body weight (95% CI −5.16 to −2.83).</P><P>Similar degrees of weight loss were seen with different ways of delivering the implementation: <UL><LI>By health professionals, −4.27% (95% CI −5.85 to −2.70)</LI><LI>By lay educators, −3.15% (95% CI −5.46 to −0.83)</LI><LI>Through electronic media, −4.20% (95% CI −7.62 to −0.77)</LI></UL></P><P>&quot;Our finding that lay community members are as effective at motivating weight loss as higher-salaried professionals has enormous importance for the scalability and economic sustainability of diabetes interventions,&quot; observed Ali and colleagues.</P><P>Studies in which there were more group sessions were associated with greater weight loss, with an increased loss of 0.26% for each additional session.</P><P>Costs associated with the intervention ranged from $934 in programs that included six group sessions to $1,075 for programs with 16 sessions.</P><P>Key to the success of a nationwide diabetes prevention effort will be increasing public awareness about diabetes, developing &quot;structured, sustainable, and effective programs,&quot; and maintaining weight loss motivation and momentum in participants, according to the researchers.</P><P>&quot;Meanwhile, the rigorous pursuit of innovative diabetes risk-reduction policies and systems to link high-risk groups to effective and affordable diabetes prevention programs must continue,&quot; Ali and colleagues stated.</P><DIV style="float:left;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#8dabbc;font-family:arial;font-size:12px;background-color:#DBE9F2;padding:5px;"><P>Wang's study was supported by the American Heart Asssociation Western States Affiliate and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.</P><P>The authors of the three studies had no relevant financial disclosures.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV style="font-size:12px;"><DIV style="font-size:12px;"><B>Primary source: </B>Health Affairs
