–<SPAN class="hn-date">14 hours ago</SPAN> </P><P>Further doubt has been cast on a study suggesting hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases the risk of breast cancer.</P><P>A link between HRT and the disease has proved controversial, with several studies suggesting the finding has been blown out of proportion.</P><P>However, other research has reinforced the link or shown a drop in breast cancer rates alongside declining HRT use.</P><P>Writing in the Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care, experts said the Million Women Study in the UK - which has reiterated the link several times - does not in fact establish HRT as a cause of breast cancer.</P><P>However, they did not rule out that HRT may increase risk of the disease.</P><P>First published in 2003 and funded by Cancer Research UK, the Million Women Study found that using combined HRT doubles a woman's risk of developing breast cancer compared with women not taking HRT.</P><P>An update in August last year found similar results after a longer follow-up, including a &quot;rapid fall in risk after HRT is stopped&quot;.</P><P>But experts from South Africa, Germany and the UK analysed the study and said: &quot;HRT may or may not increase the risk of breast cancer, but the Million Women Study did not establish that it does.&quot;</P><P>The authors examined criteria applied to scientific research to show a causal link, such as biases and biological implausibility, to review the findings of the study.</P><P>Their analysis highlighted several design flaws that they say would have skewed the findings. For example, cancers detected within a few months of the study's start would have already been present when the women were enrolled in the research, but these were not excluded, they said.</P><P id="hn-distributor-copyright"><SPAN>Copyright ©  2012   The Press Association.
