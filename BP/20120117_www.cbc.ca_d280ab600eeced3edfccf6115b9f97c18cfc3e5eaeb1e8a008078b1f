And the best way is not through Twitter.&quot;</P><P>Badry said she didn't fall ill but four other Calgary students did when the outbreak hit during the conference gala.</P><P>&quot;We were all dressed up and running outside and people were just vomiting everywhere,&quot; she said. </P><P>Six out of 10 students from the Aquinian at St. Thomas University in Fredericton also got sick.</P><P>&quot;While we haven't had it confirmed, we're pretty sure its Norwalk virus given how it presented and developed,&quot; said Suzanne Germain of the Vancouver Island Health Authority.</P><P>&quot;We suspect a student, or a few students, contracted this somehow — it takes one to two days to incubate — then they travelled to the meeting, and then it spread quite rapidly among the student group.&quot;</P><P>Noroviruses are found in the stool or vomit of infected people.</P><P>People can become infected through direct contact with an infected person, by touching contaminated surfaces or objects, or by eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated.</P><P>Symptoms usually last only 48 to 72 hours.</P><P>The 74th NASH conference began Wednesday and ended Sunday in Victoria. It was hosted by the Martlet, the student newspaper at the University of Victoria, and the Nexus, the paper for students at Camosun College.</P></DIV><DIV id="storytools" class="wrap8 clearfix sclt-share"><H3 class="metanav">Share Tools</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
