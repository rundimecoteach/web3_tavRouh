Rock Veilleux of the Canadian Forces and Maj. Frank Wegener of the German Air Force, who was flying the aircraft.</P><P>A report released Wednesday by the air force's Directorate of Flight Safety said they noticed a change in the engine sound, then a warning light.</P><P>Declaring an emergency, they prepared for a forced landing, but had to eject a mile short of the runway. The aircraft was destroyed in the resulting crash inside the base's perimeter.</P><P>The investigation indicated fatigue caused a low-pressure turbine blade to crack, then fail. The engine vibrated so badly that it seized.</P><P>An investigation to determine the cause of the fatigue is ongoing, the report said.</P><P>A report into a 2001 Hawk crash at Cold Lake also noted a missing low-pressure turbine blade from the engine, &quot;which is similar to LPT blade failures in four previous CF Hawk aircraft occurrences.&quot;</P><DIV class="copyright">Â© Copyright (c) The Regina Leader-Post</DIV></DIV><DIV class="clear">Â </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
