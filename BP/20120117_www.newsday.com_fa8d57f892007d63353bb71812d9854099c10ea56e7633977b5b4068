The website links to promotional materials for the drug.</P><P>Type 2 is the most <A href="/topics/Common_%28musician%29">common</A> form of diabetes. In Type 2 diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin or does not use it efficiently, allowing excess sugar, or glucose, to accumulate in the blood.</P><P>The 64-year-old Deen, known as &quot;the <A href="/topics/Queen_%28band%29">Queen</A> of Southern cuisine,&quot; appears on <A href="/topics/Food_Network">Food Network</A>.</P><DIV id="myRating" class="rate"><STRONG>Be the first to rate:</STRONG><DIV><SPAN id="averageRating" class="rating user star0">0</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
