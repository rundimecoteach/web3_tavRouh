But recent research has shown that some wild birds' patterns of flights and stopovers during migrations, or moulting times, differ between El Nino and La Nina years.</P><P>&quot;Our best guess is this brings together birds [in La Nina conditions] that don't otherwise mix, and that allows the genetic reassortment to take place,&quot; Professor Shaman told BBC News.</P><P>Yet the fact that many other La Nina periods have not been followed by a pandemic indicate that other factors must also be involved.</P><P>If the swine flu pandemic of 2009-10 was part of this pattern, the crossing of viral strains must have had something to do with birds as well as pigs.</P><P>As wild migratory birds will sometimes visit farms and as domestic flocks of ducks or chickens often live alongside pigs, especially in developing countries, this is quite feasible.</P><P>Professor Shaman cautions that the link is far from being firm enough that it could be used as a tool to forecast pandemics.</P><P>But the monitoring of birds, pigs, people and the genetics of the influenza virus have all been stepped up in response to recent outbreaks of both swine flu and bird flu.</P><P>And this, he believes, should in time show whether the theory is correct.</P><P>&quot;Now we can look at viral gene flow in a number of birds, pigs and people - and we might be able to get something more statistically robust, to get a better sense of the mechanisms.&quot;</P><P><EM>Follow Richard on </EM><A href="http://twitter.com/#!/BBCRBlack">Twitter</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
