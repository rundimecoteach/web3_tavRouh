</P></DIV><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Serious accidents involving pedestrians wearing headphones while using electronic devices such as iPods have tripled, warn researchers.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">They found a dramatic rise in injuries to people using headphones while walking in the street, particularly among young men.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">There is increasing concern about the near trance-like state people can apparently enter while using mobile phones, MP3 players or electronic personal organisers. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Psychologists call this ‘divided attention’ or ‘inattentional blindness’ and it has become a focus for road safety campaigners.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;"> A U.S. study shows the number of people suffering serious injury while using headphones tripled in six years.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">The research, published in the Injury Prevention journal, analysed U.S. data from 2004 to last year on injuries to pedestrians using headphones.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;"> Cases involving mobile phones, including hands-free, or cyclists were excluded.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">During the study period, there were a total of 116 reports of death or injury, jumping from 16 in 2004/5 to 47 in 2010/11. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Eighty-one of the 116 collisions – 70 per cent – resulted in the person dying. In a quarter of cases a warning – such as a horn or siren – was sounded before the crash.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Two out of three victims were men and under the age of 30, with around one in ten of all cases under the age of 18. </FONT></P><DIV class="relatedItemsTopBorder"> </DIV><DIV class="relatedItems"><UL><LI><A href="/sciencetech/article-2087339/iPhone-5-waterproof-Apple-Samsung-talking-spray-proofing-company.html">Could the next iPhone be waterproof?

There are many close calls. You’ve only got to look around to see it’s on the rise.’</FONT></P><DIV class="clear"> </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
