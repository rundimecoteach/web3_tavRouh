									The working time directive from the European Union (EU) and the poor English language skills that doctors from the EU have are putting the health of patients at risk, according to the heads of two royal colleges.The president of the Royal College of Surgeons Professor Norman Williams and Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, wrote in a letter to the Daily Telegraph: &quot;The language competency of doctors from the EU working in Britain, and the stifling effect of the European working time directive on the time that trainee doctors have to learn on the job, need urgent action.&quot;They went on: &quot;EU laws that apply to all sectors can have unintended consequences in healthcare that can put patients at risk, whether in Britain or other member states. The increased mobility of health professionals in the EU has highlighted huge variations both in the practical abilities of professionals of similar grades, and in the systems set up to ensure quality, in different member states.&quot;In response, the Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said: &quot;We agree that for too long patients have been let down by European rules which allowed doctors to operate in the UK without the necessary safeguards. That's why I announced last year new rules on checking doctors' language skills and new powers to take action against doctors who can't speak English properly.&quot;He added: &quot;We want to revise the [European working time directive] to give the NHS the flexibility it needs on training. Our overriding concern must be to protect patients.&quot;
