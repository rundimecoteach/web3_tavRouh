This is causing major problems in treating them.</P><P>&quot;The Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians wishes to inform all  parents that it is best to refrain from giving their children these medications  in the presence of fever. These medications are available in the market under  different trade names hence, it is important that you check the labels of all  medications available for control of fever prior to giving them to your child.</P><P>&quot;It is advisable to use only paracetamol at the recommended  dosage as a medication, to bring down such fevers, in addition to tepid  sponging.&quot;</P><DIV class="row"> </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
