	The hospital cured his pneumonia, but the bill — for an eye-popping $44 million — made him sick.</P><P>
	Unemployed doorman <A title="Alexis Rodriguez" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Alexis+Rodriguez">Alexis Rodriguez</A> couldn’t believe his eyes when he opened an envelope from Bronx-Lebanon Hospital last week and saw what he appeared to owe.</P><P>
	“I almost had an asthma attack,” said Rodriguez, 28, just one of several hundred patients to receive absurdly inflated bills because of a “system error.”</P><P>
	His amount due was $44,776,587 for outpatient services that in reality amounted to no more than $300.</P><P>
	Initially, Rodriguez panicked because he had spent three weeks in the hospital with pneumonia in the spring and knew he had to pay part of the $40,000 cost.</P><P>
	But he quickly realized the terrifying invoice couldn’t be right. He called the billing company and found out he wasn’t the only one with sticker shock.</P><P>
	The billing firm, PHY Services, said it was a simple mistake: The subcontractor that prints the bills put the invoice number into the “amount due” field.</P><P>
	“We are sending an apology letter to everyone who received it,” said PHY Services rep <A title="Ricardo Paul" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Ricardo+Paul">Ricardo Paul</A>.</P><P>
	The company has apparently been deluged with complaints. A recording for callers says:</P><P>
	“If you are calling with respect to a billing statement for services provided at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, please disregard the statement</P><P>
	. You will be receiving a new statement shortly. “</P><P>
	Rodriguez said that even though no harm was done to his bottom line, the sloppiness surprised him.</P><P>
	“It was a big error,” he said.</P><P>
	“I think they should have somebody look over the bills before they send them out.</P><P>
	“I understand manpower may be down, but to send out a lot of bills with numbers that big — someone could have had a heart attack.”</P><P>
	Hospital spokesman <A title="Errol Schneer" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Errol+Schneer">Errol Schneer</A> said he didn’t blame Rodriguez for being upset.</P><P>
	“We certainly share any concerns he would have,” he said.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
