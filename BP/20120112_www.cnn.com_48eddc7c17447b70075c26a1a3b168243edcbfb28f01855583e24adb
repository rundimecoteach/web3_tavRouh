But in a report issued this week, congressional investigators found the company that conducted a July safety audit at the farm, Bio Food Safety, gave it near-perfect marks despite finding three &quot;major deficiencies.&quot;</P><P>In particular, it noted that the company washed its cantaloupe in water that was not treated with chlorine or any other anti-bacterial additive -- a process the FDA said was inconsistent with its recommendations and &quot;a probable cause of the contamination.&quot; The inspector did not take points off for the finding, the report states.</P><P>&quot;The guidance which Bio Food Safety did not consider in its audit represents the agency's best and most timely advice on how processing should be handled,&quot; the House Energy and Commerce Committee concluded in its bipartisan report.</P><P>The September outbreak killed 30 people, triggered a miscarriage in one woman and sickened more than 115 others -- the deadliest outbreak of foodborne illness in more than a quarter-century, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</P><P><A href="http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/28/faqs-of-listeria-monocytogenes/">What is listeria monocytogenes?</A></P><P>Bio Food Safety President Jerry Walzel declined comment on the report Wednesday, citing a pending lawsuit. But he told committee investigators that his company followed FDA regulations, and the agency's guidelines are &quot;opinions.&quot;</P><P>&quot;We are not supposed to be opinionated on this,&quot; the report quotes Walzel. &quot;We are supposed to go by FDA's regulations ... FDA should have mandated that you cannot sell cantaloupes that have not been sanitized.&quot;</P><P>The report states that in 2010, Walzel recommended Jensen Farms replace a water cooler used to chill the fruit before packaging, citing it as a potential safety &quot;hot spot.&quot; The owners replaced the device in 2011, buying equipment that had been used in a potato plant and refitting it.</P><P>In October, the FDA found that equipment &quot;did not lend itself to be easily or routinely cleaned and sanitized,&quot; allowing dirt to build up. It also criticized Jensen Farms for allowing water to pool on the floor of the packing facility: samples of that water tested positive for the bacteria behind the outbreak.</P><P>Jensen Farms had not returned a phone call seeking comment Wednesday afternoon.</P><P>The FDA does not regulate private auditors such as Bio Food Safety, a subcontractor for the company Jensen Farms hired to conduct inspections. Under a law passed in 2011, the agency is required to set up an accreditation system and set standards for those firms.</P><DIV class="cnn_strybtntoolsbttm"><DIV class="cnn_strybtntools"><DIV class="cnn_strybtntoolsBot"><DIV class="cnnOverlayMenuContainer"><DIV class="cnnOverlayMenu" id="cnnShareThisStory456"><DIV class="cnnShareThisBox"><DIV class="cnnShareBoxContent"><DIV class="cnnShareContent"><DIV id="cnnShareThisContent"><DIV class="cnnShareThisTitle"><H6>Share this on:</H6></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
