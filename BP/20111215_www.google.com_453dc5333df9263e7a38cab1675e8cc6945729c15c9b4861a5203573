–<SPAN class="hn-date">47 minutes ago</SPAN> </P><P>The General Medical Council (GMC) is to issue guidance on how to deal with complaints against doctors who may have assisted in suicides.</P><P>Case examiners and the regulator's investigation committee will be advised about what action to take over allegations that doctors have helped people to die. There will be a public consultation on the draft guidance once it is published in January.</P><P>It follows a patient asking the GMC what advice or support, if any, doctors could give to patients who were considering ending their lives.</P><P>Niall Dickson, chief executive of the GMC, said: &quot;The issue of assisted suicide is complex and sensitive. We already have clear guidance for doctors that they must always act within the law and assisting or encouraging suicide remains a criminal offence. This guidance will not in any way change the legal position for doctors.</P><P>&quot;We recognise, however, that there are a range of actions which could be considered as assisting in a suicide, such as providing information to a patient about suicide or providing practical assistance for someone to travel to a clinic such as Dignitas.</P><P>&quot;Some of these actions may not lead to criminal charges but may still lead to complaints to us about a doctor's fitness to practise.&quot;</P><P>The guidance will include factors that might be relevant in determining the seriousness of each case. It will not cover euthanasia -in which a doctor's actions lead to a patient's death - as this is already covered by existing guidance.</P><P>In the last decade, the GMC has examined three cases where a doctor was said to have helped somebody to die.</P><P>One resulted from a conviction for assisting suicide in Canada and none from any conviction in the UK.</P><P id="hn-distributor-copyright"><SPAN>Copyright ©  2011   The Press Association.
