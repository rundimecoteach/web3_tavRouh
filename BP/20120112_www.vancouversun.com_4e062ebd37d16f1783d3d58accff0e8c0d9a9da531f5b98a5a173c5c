Another report suggests the workplace would save money if it invested in treatment.</H1><H2 id="photocredit"><B>Photograph by: </B>Stock photo, Thinkstock</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="page1"><P>On top of the personal anguish suffered by someone afflicted with <A href="http://bodyandhealth.canada.com/channel_main.asp?channel_id=1053" target="_blank"><B>depression</B></A>, a new study shows that, gone untreated, this form of <A href="http://bodyandhealth.canada.com/channel_main.asp?channel_id=11" target="_blank"><B>mental illness</B></A> also takes a toll on the economy.</P><P>Research from the Toronto-based <A href="http://www.camh.net/" target="_blank"><B>Centre for Addiction and Mental Health</B></A> indicates treatment for depression can help people suffering from the condition stay productive on the job.</P><P>The centre said mental illness, in general, costs the Canadian economy about $51 billion a year, with one-third of that due to lost productivity.</P><P>Surveys of 3,000 Alberta workers in 2009 found that, among the 255 people indicating they suffered a depressive episode within a year of being interviewed, those who received treatment were more likely to report being able to function at a highly productive level at work.</P><P>Carolyn Dewa, who heads the centre's research division for workplace health, said such finds make sense, given common symptoms of depression, such as concentration loss and <A href="http://bodyandhealth.canada.com/channel_condition_info_details.asp?disease_id=77&amp;channel_id=2045&amp;relation_id=33193" target="_blank"><B>insomnia</B></A>.</P><P>&quot;To get help with some of those symptoms would really help people to better function,&quot; she said.</P><P>Those who reported experiencing a severe depressive episode were seven times more likely to report being able to perform at a highly productive rate if they had received treatment compared to those untreated.</P><P>For those who went through a moderate episode, treatment made them 2.5 times more likely to reach this optimum level of productivity, the study found.</P><P>The effect of treatment on those who had gone through a mildly depressive episode was not found to be significant.</P><P>To be considered as having been depressed, a respondent had to point out at least a two-week period in the year previous to the interview when they felt depressed and had a lack of interest in regular activities. The degree of severity was determined by how many other symptoms they reported, such as a loss of appetite, low self-esteem and suicidal thoughts.</P><P>In this study, it was found that 40 per cent of those who had experienced a severe depressive episode did not get treatment for it â which would include therapy, medication or both â 57 per cent reporting a moderate episode were untreated, and it was 82 per cent for those with mild symptoms.</P><P>The centre called on employers to make treatment options for depression more accessible to their workers.</P><P>&quot;It's not even just about out-of-pocket payments and things like that,&quot; Dewa said. &quot;Can people get time off to go to the doctor or to get counselling? Because to get those kinds of treatment, often you have to go during working hours.&quot;</P><P>She highlighted the value in employer-benefits plans that cover drugs and therapy for depression.</P><P>Dewa said it typically costs an employer about $18,000 if a worker takes a leave of absence due to mental illness, due to the disruption in workflow. While it's unclear what it would cost organizations to improve the accessibility of treatment options â which also could include a communications policy to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness â she said it would be less expensive than having the employee take leave.</P><P>She added that including mental-health drugs and therapy under the umbrella of universal, publicly funded health care is worth consideration.</P><P>The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health's study follows a report from the <A href="http://www.oecd.org/home/0,2987,en_2649_201185_1_1_1_1_1,00.html" target="_blank"><B>Organization for Economic Development and Co-operation</B></A> last month pointing out the drag mental illness has on worker productivity in industrialized countries all over the world, and how it hurts individuals' chances of employment.</P><P><I>dabma@postmedia.com</I></P><DIV class="copyright">Â© Copyright (c) Postmedia News</DIV></DIV><DIV class="clear">Â </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
