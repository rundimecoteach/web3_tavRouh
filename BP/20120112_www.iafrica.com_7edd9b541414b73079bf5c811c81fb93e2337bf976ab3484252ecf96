It seems Japan has adopted one of the West's nasty four-lettered words with great gusto, using it to describe anything that's really fantastic.</P><P>A New Yorker says he is to blame for this recent phenomenon. Owner and chef for a restaurant chain called Bubby's, Ron Silver was in Yokohama, Japan in 2009 setting up a branch of the restaurant there when he insisted on fresh produce. According to Silver, the Japanese use a lot of frozen goods and in his frustration to explain fresh to his staff, he ranted at them, &quot;I mean <EM>f**king fresh</EM>, man.&quot;</P><P>The following day, his staff asked him whether by fresh he meant canned, which started him ranting again, &quot; What do you not understand about <EM>f**ing fresh</EM>?&quot;</P><P>According to the original report on Gawker.com, Silver's staff may have been teasing him the whole time as they soon decorated the Bubby's logo with the slogan, &quot;f***kin fresh&quot;.</P><P>So catchy is it, that it's become the unofficial slogan of the Osaka branch, written on the menus and adverts, like &quot;F**kin Fresh &amp; Delicious food&quot; and &quot;Bubby's F**kin Fresh lemonade&quot; — dropping the &quot;g&quot; seems a popular spelling of the word.</P><P>Now, it seems, the new-found adjective has been adopted elsewhere, with signs advertising a &quot;f**kin sale&quot; in Osaka, Japan, recently reported by Gawker.com.</P><P>Whether or not the phrase originated at Bubby's, one thing is for certain, the Japanese have a certain way with the English language.</P></SPAN></DIV></DIV><SPAN id="postArticleContainer1"> </SPAN><SPAN id="postArticleContainer2"> </SPAN></SPAN></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
