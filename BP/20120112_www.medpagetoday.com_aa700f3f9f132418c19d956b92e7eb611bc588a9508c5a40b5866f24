Pacemakers can detect subclinical episodes of rapid atrial rate.</P><P>To examine the association between these subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias and clinical outcomes, Connolly and colleagues started the ASSERT study, which included 2,580 patients 65 and older enrolled from 23 countries. All of the patients had hypertension, either a pacemaker (95%) or ICD (5%) placed recently, and no history of atrial fibrillation.</P><P>The researchers monitored the patients for three months with their implantable devices to detect subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias, defined as episodes involving an atrial rate greater than 190 beats per minute for more than six minutes. Follow-up for clinical events lasted for an average of two-and-a-half years.</P><P>The presence of a subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmia within the first three months was associated with higher rates of clinical atrial fibrillation or flutter on a surface electrocardiogram (15.7% versus 3.1%; HR 5.56) and ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (4.2% versus 1.7%; HR 2.49) during follow-up.</P><P>Both differences were statistically significant (<EM>P</EM>≤0.007) and maintained significance after adjustment for other predictors of stroke.</P><P>Of the 51 patients who had an ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, 11 had a subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmia and none had clinical atrial fibrillation in the first three months.</P><P>The researchers found that the population attributable risk of stroke or systemic embolism related to subclinical atrial fibrillation was 13%, which is similar to the attributable risk of stroke associated with clinical atrial fibrillation found in the Framingham Heart Study.</P><P>A second objective in the study was to determine whether continuous atrial overdrive pacing influenced clinical outcomes. After randomizing the patients with pacemakers to having overdrive pacing turned on or off, the researchers found that it did not prevent atrial fibrillation or any other outcome. However, the study was underpowered to make firm conclusions about overdrive pacing outcomes.</P><P>Connolly and colleagues noted that only 15.7% of patients with subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias developed clinical atrial fibrillation, &quot;suggesting that there can be a lag between subclinical events and clinical detection.&quot;</P><P>Also, they advised that Holter monitoring for a few days may not detect subclinical atrial fibrillation as the median time that subclinical tachyarrhythmias were detected within the first three months was 36 days.</P><P>The investigators said that patients with pacemakers may have a higher prevalence of subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias than other high-risk populations, suggesting the findings are not generalizable. However, previous studies have suggested that other elderly populations have a high prevalence of subclinical atrial fibrillation, they said.</P><DIV style="float:left;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#8dabbc;font-family:arial;font-size:12px;background-color:#DBE9F2;padding:5px;"><P>The study was supported by St. Jude Medical.</P><P>Connolly reported receiving grant support and lecture fees from St. Jude Medical.
