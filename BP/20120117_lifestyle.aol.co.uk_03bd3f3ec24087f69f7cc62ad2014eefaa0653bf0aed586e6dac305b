Thousands of bottles of Sterimar Isotonic spray have been recalled after two batches were found to be contaminated with the bacteria Pseudomonas stutzeri and Sphingomonas paucimobilis.
The <A href="http://lifestyle.aol.co.uk/2011/12/16/half-of-all-orange-juice-from-cafes-may-contain-bacteria/">bacteria</A>, which is usually present in soil and water, can cause fever, nasal or facial tenderness and discoloured mucus in people with nasal problems or who have recently had surgery.
The health watchdog, the <A href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/index.htm">Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency</A> (MHRA), said anyone who had the product should stop using it immediately and return it to the shop they bought it from.
A statement on the MHRA website said if consumers &quot;exhibit any of the symptoms...then they should consult a healthcare professional.&quot;<DIV>
	&quot;The affected batches are FE1248b and FE1249. The batch number can be located on the product packaging and on the base of the can.&quot;</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
