	Mothers in Brighton who staged a breastfeeding flashmob demonstration in the city centre (Pic: PA)
	</P></DIV></DIV><P>A group of mothers braved the cold to stage a breastfeeding flashmob protest in a city centre to declare their right to feed their babies in public. </P><DIV class="inline-ad span-16 last"><DIV class="caption">Advertisement &gt;&gt; </DIV></DIV><P>Up to 40 mothers, some accompanied by their partners, descended on Brighton, East Sussex, and breastfed their children in front of Christmas shoppers.</P><P>The demonstration was organised by an incensed mother after she was criticised by customers in a cafe for breastfeeding one of her daughters last week. </P><P>Claire Jones-Hughes, 38, was confronted by a group of four middle-aged women and a man in her favourite vegetarian restaurant, Wai Kika Moo Kau, after feeding four-month-old Callie. </P><P class="crosshead">Mothers feed their babies during the breastfeeding flashmob in Brighton</P><P>Mrs Jones-Hughes said: &quot;One woman said, 'It was very unpleasant watching you feed. You should have covered up more.' </P><P>&quot;When I protested, the others joined in, and the man said, 'You should have used a towel.' </P><P>&quot;I was really shocked, especially as I'd gone to a lot of effort to be discreet. </P><P>&quot;You usually get nice comments when you're with a baby, and I couldn't believe I was having this conversation. </P><P>&quot;In their world, it was completely unnatural that they should see me doing that.&quot; </P><P>Despite the support of another customer, Mrs Jones-Hughes was visibly shaken and reduced to tears by the incident. </P><P>She said: &quot;After they left, the manager came over to ask what happened and was mortified when I told him. </P><P>&quot;When I calmed down it reminded me of all the stories I've heard from other women who've had similar experiences.&quot; </P><P class="crosshead">Claire Jones-Hughes, who organised the breastfeeding flashmob demonstration</P><P>After drumming up support online, Mrs Jones-Hughes encouraged other women to brave the cold to feed their babies as part of the flashmob at the Clock Tower. </P><P>The customer services manager, who also has a three-year-old daughter Lexie, said she hoped the event would give confidence to mothers who are nervous about breastfeeding in public. </P><P>She said: &quot;I've had comments from all over the country about how great it is to make a stand. </P><P>&quot;I've got two daughters who may have children themselves one day. If they choose to breastfeed in the future I'd never want anyone to make them feel how I felt.&quot; </P><P>Local NCT committee member Suzanne Borrell said: &quot;There is an assumption that Brighton is generally seen as a very tolerant, broad-minded community but as this and previous unpleasant episodes show, nowhere is safe from such bigotry.&quot; </P><P>Faruk Bulut, the owner of the cafe in Brighton's Kensington Gardens, said he supported the right of mothers to breastfeed their children where they want. </P><P>He added: &quot;The restaurant was very busy when the incident happened so I wasn't aware of it until afterwards. </P><P>&quot;We support the idea that mothers should feel free to feed their babies and we never make it difficult for them. In fact, the cafe is very popular with mothers.&quot; </P></DIV></TM:CONTENTOBJECT></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
