Workers in Britain are turning to the <A href="http://lifestyle.aol.co.uk/2012/01/09/drinkers-told-to-abstain-from-alcohol-at-least-two-days-a-week/">bottle</A> and the fridge in a bid to beat the boredom of their office jobs.
The results of a new survey have shown that a quarter of staff in the country binge on chocolates or high-calorie coffees, or drink too much after work.
Researchers from the University of Central Lancashire surveyed 102 office workers and found half said they had more chance of making mistakes if they were bored.
The research also found that 75% of <A href="http://lifestyle.aol.co.uk/2011/12/30/dream-job-fantasies-still-plague-almost-half-of-workers/">workers</A> admitted to losing concentration if they were given a repetitive, uninteresting task to carry out.
Researcher Dr Sandi Mann said &quot;Managers might consider using boredom proneness as a tool when selecting staff.&quot;
&quot;My analysis suggests that the most significant cause of office boredom is an undemanding workload, so managers should look at ways of reducing sources of workplace boredom and encourage better ways of coping.&quot;
&quot;This could involve enrichment programmes such as job rotation, multi-skilling and empowerment. Encouraging healthier ways of coping with boredom could include education or providing healthy snacks and drinks in canteens.&quot;
If you're always bored at work, it's worth bearing in mind the words of the late Steve Jobs, who said in 2005: &quot;You've got to find what you love...your <A href="http://lifestyle.aol.co.uk/2010/07/01/do-women-enjoy-work-more-than-men/">work</A> is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.&quot;<STRONG>How to you cope with boredom at work? Let us know below...</STRONG></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
