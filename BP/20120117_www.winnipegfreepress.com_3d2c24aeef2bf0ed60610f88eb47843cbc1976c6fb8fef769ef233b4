This week, their odds of quitting are better than ever.</P><P>It's National Non-Smoking Week and the Canadian Cancer Society has rolled out a new initiative called Break It Off to help young smokers kick the habit before they cause further damage to themselves.</P><P>&quot;The big thing is the website, BreakItOff.ca,&quot; said CCS tobacco advocacy co-ordinator Will Cooke. &quot;This was done in conjunction with Health Canada and is aimed at a younger demographic.&quot;</P><P>&quot;Right now the highest smoking rate in Manitoba is among young people. We wanted to create a tool that is relevant to that age group.&quot;</P><P>Break It Off aims to get smokers to view their relationship with cigarettes as extremely unhealthy and encourages them to &quot;break up&quot; with their addiction.</P><P>&quot;There are a lot of cool features young adults can use on the site,&quot; Cooke said. &quot;You can even end your relationship with smoking publicly with a status update on Facebook.&quot;</P><P>According to the Canadian Cancer Society, a &quot;public breakup&quot; with smoking can greatly increase the chances of success.</P><P>&quot;People successfully quit smoking in many ways and we have all sorts of tools to help them improve their chance of success,&quot; said Cooke in a media release. &quot;It's all about helping people quit and improving their odds of staying tobacco-free.&quot;</P><P>The CCS also offers their Smokers' Helpline to help all Manitobans cope with the difficulties in quitting smoking.</P><P>&quot;Medication like Champix can help, but another thing that helps people quit is getting telephone counselling,&quot; said Cooke.</P><P>Manitoba continues to have one of the highest smoking rates in Canada with about one in five Manitobans lighting up.</P><P>Benefits of butting out worth the effort</P><P>According to the Canadian Cancer Society, smokers feel pretty lousy after their initial 'breakup' with cigarettes. But here are the benefits you can expect after:</P><P>Eight hours: Increased oxygen in your system and lower blood pressure may have you feeling like a heavy weight is being lifted.</P><P>One day: Your lungs should be working better, leaving you out of breath a lot less often.</P><P>Two days: Your sense of taste and smell should be making a pleasant return.</P><P>One week: Increased blood flow to your hands and feet should have you feeling a lot less cold.</P><P>Four weeks: As your lung function continues to improve, physical activity should be quite a bit easier.</P><P>Six weeks: You should notice less coughing, sinus congestion and shortness of breath.</P><P>One year: Your risk of coronary heart disease is about half that of an average smoker.</P><P>Three years: Your risk of heart attack is similar to someone who has never smoked.</P><P>Five years: You have reduced your risk of getting cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, bladder, kidney and pancreas.</P></DIV><DIV class="article"><P class="republish">Republished from the Winnipeg Free Press print edition January 17, 2012 A7</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
