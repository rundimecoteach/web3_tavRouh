But reactions turned even more derisive when it was <A href="http://www.thedaily.com/page/2012/01/13/011312-gossip-paula-deen-1-2/" target="_blank">reported</A> that the Georgia-born chef had landed <A href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2012/01/13/paula-deen-has-diabetes-report.html" target="_blank">a multimillion-dollar deal</A> to hawk a diabetes drug for a pharmaceutical company.

It remains to be seen whether Ms. Deen will try her hand at healthier recipes, or continue pushing deep-fried confections on America while on this purportedly lucrative pharma contract.
</P><P>
With the news, eyes are also now turning back on Anthony Bourdain, who seethed that Ms. Deen is “the worst, most dangerous person to America”<A href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2011/08/paula-deen-anthony-bourdain-food-network-fight.html" target="_blank">back in August</A>.

(Feeding them luscious <A href="http://www.pauladeen.com/recipes/recipe_view/twinkie_pie/" target="_blank">Twinkie Pie</A>? Here’s hoping not.)

New York Times columnist Frank Bruni <A href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/opinion/bruni-unsavory-culinary-elitism.html?_r=3&amp;ref=dining" target="_blank">jumped into the fray</A> then too, dissing Mr. Bourdain for being an elitist culinary hypocrite who was serving up fatty duck confit as he assailed Ms. Deen’s monstrosities. </P><P>“You can almost imagine Bourdain and Deen as political candidates, a blue-state paternalist squaring off against a red-state populist over correct living versus liberty in all its artery-clogging, self-destructive glory,” Mr. Bruni wrote.
