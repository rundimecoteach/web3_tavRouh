Mr </FONT><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Rodriguez was just one of several hundred patients to receive absurdly inflated bills because of a 'system error'.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">The amount he owed was $44,776,587 for outpatient services that in reality amounted to no more than $300.</FONT></P><DIV class="relatedItemsTopBorder"> </DIV><DIV class="relatedItems"><H4>More...</H4><UL><LI><A href="/news/article-2086763/Cancer-cure-High-school-student-Angela-Zhang-devised-cure-cancer.html">'This is a Cinderella moment for a science nerd like me' The high school student who devised a cure for cancer (that we could be using in 15 years) </A></LI></UL></DIV><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Mr Rodriguez panicked at first because he had spent three weeks in the hospital with pneumonia in the spring and knew he had to pay part of the $40,000 cost.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">But he quickly realised the terrifying invoice couldn’t be right. He called the billing company and found out he wasn’t the only one with sticker shock.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">The billing firm, PHY Services, said it was a simple mistake: The subcontractor that prints the bills put the invoice number into the 'amount due' field.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">The company has apparently been deluged with complaints and said it would be sending out an apology.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">A recording for callers says: 'If you are calling with respect to a billing statement for services provided at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, please disregard the statement. You will be receiving a new statement shortly.

'I think they should have somebody look over the bills before they send them out.'</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Hospital spokesman Errol Schneer said he didn’t blame Mr Rodriguez for being upset.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">'We certainly share any concerns he would have,' he said.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;"> </FONT></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
