The degree of severity was determined by how many other symptoms they reported, such as a loss of appetite, low self-esteem and suicidal thoughts.</P><P>In this study, it was found that 40 per cent of those who had experienced a severe depressive episode did not get treatment for it - which would include therapy, medication or both - 57 per cent reporting a moderate episode were untreated, and it was 82 per cent for those with mild symptoms.</P><P>The centre called on employers to make treatment options for depression more accessible to their workers.</P><P>&quot;It's not even just about out-of-pocket payments and things like that,&quot; Dewa said. &quot;Can people get time off to go to the doctor or to get counselling? Because to get those kinds of treatment, often you have to go during working hours.&quot;</P><P>She highlighted the value in employer-benefits plans that cover drugs and therapy for depression.</P><P>Dewa said it typically costs an employer about $18,000 if a worker takes a leave of absence due to mental illness, due to the disruption in workflow. While it's unclear what it would cost organizations to improve the accessibility of treatment options - which also could include a communications policy to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness - she said it would be less expensive than having the employee take leave.</P><P>She added that including mental-health drugs and therapy under the umbrella of universal, publicly funded health care is worth consideration.</P><P>The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health's study follows a report from the <A href="http://www.oecd.org/home/0,2987,en_2649_201185_1_1_1_1_1,00.html" target="_blank"><B>Organization for Economic Development and Co-operation</B></A> last month pointing out the drag mental illness has on worker productivity in industrialized countries all over the world, and how it hurts individuals' chances of employment.</P><P><I>dabma@postmedia.com</I></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
