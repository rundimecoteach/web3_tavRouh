</A></LI></UL></DIV><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">One of the patients in the study had 
their entire oesophagus removed because a small pre-cancerous area had 
been identified – which using the dye was found to have been very small 
and could have been treated without surgery.</FONT></P><DIV class="thinFloatRHS"><P class="imageCaption">Deadly: Oesophageal cancer is one of the most fatal because it is often missed or wrongly diagnosed until it is too late</P></DIV><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">
Two patients whose cancer had not shown up using the current imaging 
methods - which usually only detect when a tumour has formed - were 
found to have clear areas which needed treatment.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Lead researcher Dr Rebecca Fitzgerald, of the  Medical Research 
Council’s Cancer Cell Unit in Cambridge said: ‘Current methods to screen
for oesophageal cancer are controversial - they are costly, 
uncomfortable for the patient and are not completely accurate.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">‘Our technique highlights the exact position of a developing oesophageal
cancer, and how advanced it is, giving a more accurate picture.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">‘This could spare patients radical surgery to remove the oesophagus that
can result in having to eat much smaller more regular meals and worse 
acid-reflux.’</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Cases of the disease have doubled over the past 25 years particularly in
men, thought to be linked to alcohol and smoking. Only 1 in 12 people 
survive for five years after diagnosis.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">The researchers, funded by Cancer Research UK, tested the treatment on 
80 biopsies from people with Barrett’s oesophagus, a condition which 
increases the risk of oesophageal cancer, as well as four patients with 
cancer.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">They say the dye is ‘relatively cheap’ and unlikely to cause side 
effects as it uses a type of wheat germ protein found in our normal 
diet.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">This binds to glycans, sugar molecules on the surface of cells inside 
the oesophagus and they added a flourescent tag to make it glow green 
under light of a specific wavelength.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">It can then be seen using an endoscope – an optical tube passed down the oesophagus.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">When diseased, the glycans’ structure changes – and current imaging methods cannot pick up these tiny changes.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">The test needs to be trialled on newly diagnosed patients but the 
researchers, whose study is published today (Mon) in the journal Nature 
Medicine, believe it could be used routinely on patients within five 
years.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">A UK trial is already being planned.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Dr Julie Sharp, senior science information manager at Cancer Research 
UK, said: ‘Oesophageal cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to 
detect and treat.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">‘We urgently need new ways to detect the cancer earlier, and this dye 
offers a great opportunity to treat the cancer more promptly and more 
successfully, potentially saving many lives a year.’</FONT></P><DIV class="clear"> </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
