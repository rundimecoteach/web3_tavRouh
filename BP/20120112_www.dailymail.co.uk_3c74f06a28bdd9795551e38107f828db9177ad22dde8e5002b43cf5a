The company accused the Government of dodging its responsibilities and added that any care it gave will be better than that provided by the NHS, which it said might botch the operations. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Together, the four businesses account for 60 per cent of the 50,000 PIP implants used in Britain.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">With the NHS pledging to step in when private firms refuse to co-operate, the stance taken by the ‘big four’ could cost the taxpayer millions.</FONT></P><DIV class="relatedItemsTopBorder"> </DIV><DIV class="relatedItems"><H4>More...</H4><UL><LI><A href="/health/article-2083715/NHS-hospital-half-PIP-breast-implants-burst-thats-26-times-official-rupture-rate.html">NHS hospital where half of PIP breast implants burst (that's 26 times the official rupture rate)</A></LI></UL></DIV><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">It is estimated that if the NHS funded the removal of all 50,000 implants, the total bill would reach £150million. Even paying for a third of them would cost £50million – the amount the clinics are estimated to have made by choosing the cut-price PIP implants over better-quality ones.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">On Friday, Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said any woman who had breast implants on the NHS would have the right to have them taken out for nothing. The advice stands even if the implants have not ruptured because many women, who will mainly be breast  cancer patients, are anxious their health could be at risk.</FONT></P><DIV class="thinFloatRHS"><P class="imageCaption">Promise: Andrew Lansley has said that any woman who had the implants on the NHS would be entitled to have them removed for nothing</P></DIV><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Mr Lansley said private clinics had a ‘moral responsibility’ to produce the same standard of service, but if they refuse to co-operate, the NHS will step in.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">While he did not order a mass recall, this statement effectively gave the green light for all those who want them removed to have it done. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Several large private chains, including Nuffield, Spire Healthcare and BMI, have agreed to comply.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">But others are resisting, saying the fault lies with the Government and its medical watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory products Agency, for allowing the implants to be sold in the UK.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Transform, which sold PIP implants to almost 4,300 patients, is ‘reviewing its options’.  But as it stands, it is charging patients £2,800 to have them taken out and better-quality ones put in. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">It has said that doing the operations for free would put it out of business.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Chief executive Nigel Robertson said: ‘If this catastrophic situation was our fault, we would deserve to go out of business and I would hold my hands up. This is a catastrophic failure of the regulator.’</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">The Harley Medical Group fitted 13,900 PIP implants and says it had a rupture rate of 1.8 per cent. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Chairman Mel Braham says he will pay for the cost of new implants, but only if the NHS does the surgery.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">He said the Government was responsible for the situation and could do the operations because it had hospitals ‘at its fingertips’.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">The Hospital Group says there is no evidence to suggest routine removal of the implants. Its website points worried patients towards a helpline, which is open only during office hours.</FONT></P><DIV class="thinFloatRHS"><P class="imageCaption">Outrageous: Nigel Mercer attacked Linia for their comments and said that patients would soon assume clinics were putting profits ahead of their safety</P></DIV><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Linia, which fitted 1,540 PIP implants at clinics from Chester to Bristol, is removing implants for free ‘when appropriate’ and replacing them ‘on a case-by-case basis’. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">It has accused the Government of a massive regulatory failure and claimed that any operations done on the NHS are likely to be performed ‘inadequately’ by trainee surgeons. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">A spokesman added: ‘We demand… all NHS patients are operated on by the consultants and these consultants should perform these operations outside their normal working hours for which they get paid, as we feel it is their moral obligation.’</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Nigel Mercer, past president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said the clinics pointing the finger at the MHRA had ‘bought cheap implants and used cheap surgeons for more profit’.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">He described Linia’s comments as ‘outrageous’ and warned that if clinics don’t start offering free operations, patients will assume they were putting profits before patient care. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Mr Mercer added: ‘These companies have huge legal resources and they have used them in the past. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">‘They can go after their own insurers and those of PIP to recoup some of the money but they need to sort their act out. </FONT></P><DIV class="clear"> </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
