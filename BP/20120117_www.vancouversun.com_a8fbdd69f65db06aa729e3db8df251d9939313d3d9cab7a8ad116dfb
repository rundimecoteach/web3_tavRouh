When people decide not to take their prescription drugs, it sets off the possibility they are putting themselves at further risk of illness, putting a potentially higher burden on the health care system.</P><P>The researchers found uninsured low-income people had a 35-per-cent chance of not paying for medications, compared with less than four per cent of high-income insured people.</P><P>&quot;It's a small portion of the population, but it's an important one. It's the people who you'd most expect to be affected by cost,&quot; Law said.</P><P>Law said the best way to ensure people take prescribed drugs is to lower or eliminate the cost of them, a topic often avoided in the national discussion about medicare.</P><P>Among the other findings in the study, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, people in B.C. are the least likely to take prescribed drugs, at a rate of nearly one-in-five (17 per cent)</P><DIV class="copyright">Â© Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun</DIV></DIV><DIV class="clear">Â </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
