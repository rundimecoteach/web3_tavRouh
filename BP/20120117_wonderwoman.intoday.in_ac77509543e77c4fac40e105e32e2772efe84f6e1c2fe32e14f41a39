The more it released in the nucleus accumbens, the greater the feelings of pleasure reported by each drinker.However, as the levels of endorphins in the orbitofrontal cortex went up, heavy drinkers felt more intoxicated -- but not those in the control group, the researchers said.&quot;This indicates that the brains of heavy drinkers are changed in a way that makes them more likely to find alcohol pleasant, and may be a clue to how problem drinking develops in the first place, Prof Mitchell said.The researchers said the results indicated that the brains of heavy or problem drinkers are changed in a way that makes them more likely to find alcohol pleasant, and may be a clue to how problem drinking develops in the first place.Howard Fields, a senior author on the study, said the results show a possible way to improve on existing medication.Although it is effective, the drug naltrexone -- which prevents binding at several opioid receptor sites -- is not widely accepted as a treatment for alcohol dependence since it can make people feel depressed.&quot;If we better understand how endorphins control drinking, we will have a better chance of creating more targeted therapies for substance addiction,&quot; he added. </DIV></DIV><DIV id="content_right"><DIV id="rightnavdiv"><DIV class="advtext">ADVERTISEMENT</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
