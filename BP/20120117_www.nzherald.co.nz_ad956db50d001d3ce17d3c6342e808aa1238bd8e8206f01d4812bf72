Employees reluctant to go back after the holidays - even if they were rain-affected - can take steps to stay on top of the back-to-work blues, say the experts.</P><P>

They have tips on ways to beat the back-to-work blues - including to start thinking about your next break.</P><P>

Auckland consultancy company Clarian Human Resources' top tip was simply to &quot;count your blessings&quot;.</P><P>

Be happy that you were away for several weeks' holiday and most of all, be thankful you were paid. Some people around the world don't have that luxury.</P><P>

Another tip is to tell your colleagues about your break. Have lunch and swap holiday stories - but avoid boasting too much to someone who has worked right through.</P><P>

Managing director Clare Parkes said one of the best ways to beat the blues was to start thinking about your next holiday.</P><P>&quot;If you've got a goal and you have something to work towards, then it does keep you motivated. If you've got something to look forward to - a holiday or even just a long weekend - it can really help a person.&quot;</P><P>

She also suggested taking breaks throughout the year.</P><P>

&quot;Typically, people have their holidays at the beginning of the year or around Christmas time.</P><P>

&quot;Perhaps something in the middle of the year would be something to plan for ... [because] it re-energises you again.</P><P>

&quot;It could be just a Friday and a Monday - just a break - even if you just do the garden for the week.&quot;</P><P>

Other tips include to &quot;get sporty&quot;. The Rugby World Cup might be over, but you can still decorate the office for the London Olympics. Or, if you're sick of all the bunting, organise a summer-themed barbecue and invite your workmates.</P><P>

Business psychologist Jasbindar Singh said it was normal to feel down in the first few weeks of starting back.</P><P>

&quot;People need to acknowledge that this is the time for transition. People coming back from holidays are in all states of mind.</P><P>

&quot;Try and ease into things. Have realistic expectations. Slowly ease into your workload.&quot;</P><P>

Ms Singh said it was important for people to start thinking about goals associated with their work, whether it be doing a course to further their knowledge or challenging themselves to achieve a goal by the end of the month, for example.</P><P>

Auckland psychologist David Stebbing had a different view, saying the last thing people going back to work should be doing is thinking about another holiday.</P><P>

That means, no photo of your holiday escape pasted to your desk.</P><P>

&quot;I think that would be quite unhelpful,&quot; he said. &quot;Part of the back-to-work blues is your job satisfaction. If you have a job that you enjoy and that you're passionate about, that largely is going to take care of the initial blues.</P><P>

&quot;You're much better to be focused on where you are right now.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>TAKE A BREAK</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>*</STRONG> Start planning your next holiday.</P><P><STRONG>*</STRONG> Take breaks during the year, not just at the end of the year.</P><P><STRONG>*</STRONG> Put a photo of your holiday escape on your desk.</P><P><STRONG>*</STRONG> Tell your colleagues about your holidays - but don't boast too much to those who have worked right through.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></OL></DIV></OL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
