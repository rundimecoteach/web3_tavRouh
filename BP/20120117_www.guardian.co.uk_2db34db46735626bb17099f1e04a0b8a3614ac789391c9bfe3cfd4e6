Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</DIV></DIV><DIV id="article-body-blocks"><P>Private medical companies refusing to replace the banned PIP breast implants free of charge should &quot;step up to their responsibilities&quot;, the health secretary, <A href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/andrewlansley" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Andrew Lansley">Andrew Lansley</A>, has said.</P><P>He said a review of private cosmetic surgery would look at how firms insured against their liabilities after the scandal, which broke in France last month.</P><P>Lansley told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the NHS would be able to help where there was a clinical need. He said women were right to be worried about the implants but insisted they did not need &quot;urgent&quot; medical attention.</P><P>The health secretary added: &quot;I am not happy about private providers not stepping up to their responsibilities at all.</P><P>&quot;I think the argument that they somehow can't afford to do so begs the question: where was their insurance? Where were they insuring themselves against their liabilities?</P><P>&quot;I think their ability to meet their liabilities to their patients should be one of the issues we look at.&quot;</P><P>Lansley's comments came as the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said the government had to make sure private providers met their &quot;moral obligation&quot; to the women affected.</P><P>He said: &quot;What I want to initiate is cross-party discussions about how we can not only change the law for the future, but how in any way we can make a difference now to the women affected, even through legislation or other means, to force those companies to face up to their responsibilities.</P><P>&quot;We must leave no stone unturned in making those companies be held to account. That's what I want to see and I hope we can do that on a cross-party basis.&quot;</P><P>On Saturday, 60 women marched on The Harley Medical Group and the Transform offices in London after they refused to replace free of charge the implants they had fitted.</P><P>The government has also launched a national press advertising campaign this weekend advising women what to do if they have the implants.</P><P>Adverts are appearing in national newspapers and will be featured on websites from Monday, while GP surgeries and other parts of the NHS will be urged to display them.</P><P>The advice reiterates the government's view that there is no evidence to support routine removal of the implants unless women have symptoms such as pain and tenderness.</P><P>It stresses that experts have found no link with cancer and there is no clear evidence of an increased risk of harm compared with other brands of breast implants.</P><P>Around 40,000 women in the UK received PIP implants manufactured by the now-closed French company Poly Implant Prostheses (PIP).</P><P>The implants were filled with non-medical grade silicone intended for use in mattresses.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
