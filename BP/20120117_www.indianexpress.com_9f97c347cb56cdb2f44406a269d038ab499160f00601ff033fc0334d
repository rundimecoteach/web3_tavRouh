</P><P>German and Swiss academics behind the discovery say the colour red may encourage diners to avoid snacking because it is commonly associated with the idea of danger, prohibition and stop, a media report said.
</P><P>They claim the discovery means the government and food industry could use red packaging on unhealthy foods as a deterrent  and could even use more red in pubs to prevent people drinking too much, they claimed.
</P><P>In the study, 41 male students were asked to drink tea from cups marked with red or blue labels. They drank 44 per cent less from cups with red labels.
</P><P>In the second part of the study, 109 people were given ten pretzels each on either a red, blue or white plate. Those with a red plate ate fewer pretzels.
</P><P>Red may be associated with alarm or something primeval, said Ursula Arens, from the British Dietetic Association.
</P><P>The results were published in the journal Appetite.</P></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
