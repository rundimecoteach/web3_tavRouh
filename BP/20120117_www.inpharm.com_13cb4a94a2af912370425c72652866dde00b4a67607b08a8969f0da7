It is Roche’s biggest selling medicine, making the firm $6.5 billion in sales in 2010.</P><P>The drug’s European approval was based on a Phase III study that showed women who received the combination of Avastin and chemotherapy, and then continued on Avastin alone, lived an average of six months longer without their disease getting worse, compared to those who received just chemotherapy.</P><P>But the study failed to show an increase in overall survival (OS), with final OS data not expected until 2013.
