was done by asking their mothers to answer almost 200 questions about 
their children from how they responded to being washed and dressed to 
how easy they were to get down to sleep. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">The results varied little between boys and girls, socio-economic status of the parents or the mother’s age.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">However, there was a clear link with the method of feeding, the journal PLoS ONE reports.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Researcher Ken Ong, of the Medical 
Research Council Epidemiology Unit in Cambridge, said that the cries of a
breast-fed baby don’t necessarily mean it is hungry.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Instead, the child may simply be seeking the comfort and closeness of its mother.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Dr Ong, a paediatrician, said: ‘If anything, what might account for the difference is that bottle-fed babies possibly get more nutrients than is typical. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">‘Research suggests that these infants may be over-nourished and gain weight too quickly. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">‘Our findings are essentially similar to other stages of life; people often find that eating is comforting.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">‘Rather than being put off breast-feeding, parents should have more realistic expectations of normal infant behaviour and should receive better understanding and support to cope with difficult infant behaviours if needed. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">‘These approaches could potentially promote successful breastfeeding, because currently many mothers attempt to breastfeed but give up after the first few weeks.’</FONT></P><DIV class="thinCenter"><P class="imageCaption">The latest research sheds new light on the theory that 'breast is best'</P></DIV><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Breastfeeding has been shown to help protect babies against obesity, eczema and ear, chest and tummy bugs.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Avoiding formula can cut the odds of child being a fussy eater in later life, as well as cut the woman’s odds of some cancers and help with weight loss.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Despite this, Britain has one of the lowest breast-feeding rates in Europe. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Around three-quarters of new mothers start breastfeeding but by four months, this number has dropped to just a one-third.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Professor Nick Wareham, director of the MRC Epidemiology Unit, said that while the results don’t prove breastfeeding to be the cause of the babies’ irritability, learning more about the subject could help boost breastfeeding rates.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">But other said that in some cases only a bottle will satisfy a baby’s hunger.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Clare Byam-Cook, a former midwife who has taught celebrities such as Kate Winslet and Natasha Kaplinsky how to feed their babies, said: ‘Breast is definitely best – as long as mother and baby are thriving on it.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">‘But if your baby is crying and unsettled and when you give it a bottle it becomes calm and settled, then a bottle is best.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">‘If you offer the baby a bottle and he doesn’t settle, then something else is the problem and the mother needs to find out what it is.’</FONT></P><DIV class="clear"> </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
