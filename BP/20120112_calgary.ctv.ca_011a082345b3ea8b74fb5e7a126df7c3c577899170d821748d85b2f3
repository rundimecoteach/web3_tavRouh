ctvcalgary.ca</P><P>Calgary police are warning the public about a lethal form of the street drug Ecstasy being distributed which is laced with a chemical five times more toxic than the drug itself. </P><P>Paramethoxy-methamphetamine or PMMA was found in five people who died from apparent Ecstasy overdoses in November and December of last year. </P><P>The findings were confirmed by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner on Wednesday. </P><P>Police say it's the first time they've ever seen the drug cut with the dangerous chemical. </P><P>They also say that the chemical compound is thought to be less expensive to produce and can be made to look similar to regular Ecstasy pills. </P><P>The cause of each individual death is still under investigation but the PMMA link remains between all the victims, all aged between 16 and 31. </P><P>&quot;This is a prime example of the gamble people take when they use illegal drugs,&quot; says S/Sgt. Mike Bossley of the Calgary Police Service Drug Unit. &quot;You never know what is in your drug: yesterday it was MDMA, today it's PMMA, and tomorrow it could be something else. There is no safe street drug, and no safe dose of a street drug.&quot; </P><P>Police say that there are absolutely no controls in illegal drug production and drugs could be cut with various substances which may lead to injury or death. </P><P>In addition, each person will have a different response to drugs and their reaction to the drug will also vary. </P><P>&quot;There are some important differences in the toxicity of PMMA compared to MDMA,&quot; says Dr. Mark Yarema, Medical Director of the Poison and Drug Information Service (PADIS). &quot;Although all have toxic effects, PMMA is considered more toxic than MDMA, with a higher incidence of seizures and elevated body temperature. Also, the onset of action of PMMA is delayed and its initial effect may be milder. This is dangerous as it may result in users ingesting several tablets to achieve a desired effect, with potentially fatal consequences.&quot; </P><P>If parents believe their child is involved in drug use and/or have information to assist with an investigation targeting a drug trafficker, they are encouraged to call the CPS Drug Tip Line at 403-206-8100 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" style="background-color:#EFEFEF"><TBODY><TR><TD>
