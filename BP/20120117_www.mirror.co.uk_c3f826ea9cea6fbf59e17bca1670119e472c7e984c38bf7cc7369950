He said yesterday: “It was so demeaning and unbelievable the way they treated me and the purser was obnoxiously rude.”</P><P>Dr Sabry, from Cambridge, waited four hours to speak to bosses, who apologised, put him on the next flight from Gatwick to Toulouse and paid for his taxi transfer.</P><P>A spokeswoman said: “All passengers travelling alone must be able to make their way to an exit unaided – it seems there was a misunderstanding regarding this.”</P></DIV></TM:CONTENTOBJECT></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
