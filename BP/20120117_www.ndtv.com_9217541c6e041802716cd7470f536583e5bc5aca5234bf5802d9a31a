It says it will send out corrected ones.The hospital didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday, which is a holiday.<I id="slider_bookmark">For NDTV Updates, follow us on <A href="http://ndtv.in/NDTVtwitter" target="_blank">Twitter</A> or join us on <A href="http://ndtv.in/NDTVfacebook" target="_balnk">Facebook</A></I></DIV><DIV class="fs14 fbld float_l pdr5" style="color:#666;">Story first published: </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
