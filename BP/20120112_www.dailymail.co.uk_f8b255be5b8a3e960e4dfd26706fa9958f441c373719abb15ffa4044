Until NICE issues final guidance, NHS bodies should make decisions locally on the funding of specific treatments. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">‘This draft guidance does not mean that people currently taking cabazitaxel will stop receiving it. They have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop.’</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Dr Jasmin Hussein, oncology medical manager of Sanofi, said ‘We are disappointed that Nice has not recommended the use of Jevtana on the basis of </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">cost. It offers an important new treatment option with significant clinical benefit.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">‘There is significant clinical need within the NHS for Jevtana – with around 100 patients having been prescribed the drug through the Cancer Drugs Fund.’</FONT></P><DIV class="clear"> </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
