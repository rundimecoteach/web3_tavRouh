				Pick Prey that Balances Their Diet</B></FONT></FONT><SDFIELD type="DATETIME" sdval="40920.5293636574" sdnum="1033;1033;NNNNMMMM D, YYYY">Thursday, January 12, 2012</SDFIELD></FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, sans-serif">University researchers have
				debunked the dogma that predators aren't picky eaters, with a new
				study finding predator animals that are given a choice of foods
				will select a diet that maximizes their chances of reproducing.</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, sans-serif">The researchers, including
				Professor Stephen Simpson, an internationally renowned biologist
				from the University of Sydney, have shown for the first time that
				predatory animals choose their food on the basis of its
				nutritional value rather than just overall calorie content.</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, sans-serif">The findings, published in the
				Proceedings of the Royal Society B on Wednesday 11 January, are
				based on a study of the ground beetle, Anchomenus dorsalis, a
				garden insect that feasts on slugs, aphids, moths, beetle larvae
				and ants.</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, sans-serif">The international team of
				scientists from the University of Sydney, the universities of
				Exeter and Oxford in the UK, Aarhus University in Denmark and
				Massey University in New Zealand, collected female beetles from
				the wild and split them into two groups in the laboratory.</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, sans-serif">Half of the beetles were
				offered a choice of foods - some that were high in protein and
				some that were high in fat. The other half were not given a
				choice of foods: some of these beetles were only given high
				protein food, while the rest were just given high fat foods.</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, sans-serif">The beetles that were given a
				choice of foods ate the proportions of protein and fat that were
				optimal for producing healthy eggs. These beetles produced more
				eggs than the other beetles in the study that had no choice of
				foods.</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, sans-serif">&quot;Contrary to standard
				dogma, predators do balance their diet and show nutritional
				wisdom,&quot; said Professor Simpson, an ARC Laureate Fellow in
				the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Sydney and
				the paper's senior author.</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, sans-serif">&quot;Although we previously
				demonstrated this characteristic in spiders, predatory beetles,
				fish, mink and cats, this is the first study to show the adaptive
				reasons and benefits of diet selection,&quot; Professor Simpson
				said.</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, sans-serif">The finding could have
				implications for predator killing and eating patterns in
				particular environments, with important consequences for food
				webs and ecological communities, said Professor Simpson.</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, sans-serif">&quot;Immediately after winter
				hibernation, when both predators and the prey are likely to have
				depleted fat stores, predators are likely to kill and eat more
				prey than if the prey were rich in fats. Conversely, if some prey
				species contain a higher concentration of fats than is optimal
				for the predator, then predators should switch their focus
				towards more protein-rich prey species.&quot;</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, sans-serif">Previous research on insects
				has shown that herbivores such as butterfly larvae and
				grasshoppers, and omnivores such as fruit flies and crickets,
				select food to give them a balanced diet. This is the first
				research to show that predators also select food on the basis of
				nutritional value.</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, sans-serif">Lead researcher Dr Kim Jensen
				of the University of Exeter said: &quot;At a time of year when
				many of us are focused on healthy eating, it is interesting to
				see that predators are also selective about what they eat.</FONT></P><P><FONT face="Arial, sans-serif">&quot;Biologists have
				previously assumed that predators cannot afford to be fussy and
				are simply focused on getting the right quantity of food, rather
				than quality. We show for the first time that they do actually
				select the foods that will give them the right balance of
				nutrients.&quot;</FONT></P><P style="margin-bottom: 0in; color: #808080"><FONT color="#808080"><FONT face="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT size="2"><I>Source:
