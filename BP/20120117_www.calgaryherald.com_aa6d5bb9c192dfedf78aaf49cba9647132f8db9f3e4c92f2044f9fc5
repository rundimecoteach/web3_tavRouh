The college's initial and limited set of requirements ought to be followed by substantial guidelines that focus on the interests of the children to be created.</P><P>The college assumed regulatory responsibility for Alberta fertility practitioners in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada's 2010 decision to strike down the federal government's law licensing and regulating fertility clinics.</P><P>Yet, relevant sections of the Assisted Human Re-production Act are still in force. In ringing tones, the preamble states, &quot;The Parliament of Canada recognizes and declares that . . . the health and well-being of children born through the application of assisted human reproductive technologies must be given priority in all decisions respecting their use.&quot;</P><P>Is this value shared by the college? Its first IVF guide-lines are focused solely on practice standards.</P><P>It is important, to be sure, that the medical practitioners and the laboratory support staff have appropriate professional qualifications and that fertility clients be screened for infectious disease. Yet, guidelines need to go beyond these essential pre-requisites.</P><P>The college requires re-cord keeping, but this, too, is limited in its detail. Sadly for children conceived by donated sperm, egg or embryo, the college has not yet required that the identity, and the medical, social and cultural history of the do-nor be recorded, preserved and then disclosed to the child at adulthood. This is standard in adoption and was recently litigated.</P><P>Suing the British Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons and the province of B.C., a donor-conceived person, Olivia Pratten, argued that her right to equal benefit of the law had been violated.</P><P>The B.C. Supreme Court judge agreed, writing, &quot;The evidence in this case . . . compels me to the conclusion that cutting off a child from half of his or her biological origins is not in that child's best interests.&quot;</P><P>Given the B.C. judicial ruling, the Alberta college should agree that creating a record for children of their progenitors is vital. A re-cord helps create the family history that can guide both prevention of genetically transmitted disease and healthy identity formation.</P><P>People conceived by donor gametes have been insisting for some time that such a record is their right. Architect Bill Cordray, who was conceived by donor sperm, writes, &quot;No legislature or court gave a gynaecologist the power to deny me my basic identity. He and thousands of other fertility physicians and clinic directors have simply presumed to sever the genealogical connections of millions of people before they are even conceived, making it impossible for these same people, when they become autonomous adults, to gain access to these important ties. This arrogation of power with-out democratic due process is illegitimate, immoral and outrageous.&quot;</P></DIV><DIV id="page2"><P>The Alberta college has another opportunity to focus on children's interests by addressing the number of embryos a fertility practitioner may insert in women. Clearly, everyone wishes to prevent another &quot;octomom&quot; - the California 2009 birth of eight babies after IVF. But any multiple pregnancy - twins and triplets - can lead to more complications than singletons for the mother during pregnancy and premature birth. Babies born early can need intensive neonatal medical treatment. Some premature infants suffer long-term consequences and others do not survive. The cost of neonatal intensive care is very high.</P><P>According to University of Montreal pediatric re-searchers Annie Janvier, Bridget Spelke and Keith J. Barrington, Canada has one of the highest rates of multiple deliveries after IVF in the world and &quot;a mandatory policy of single embryo transfer would be of substantial benefit to the health of Canadian babies while still benefiting infer-tile couples.&quot;</P><P>So it is time for the Alberta college to take a position regarding best practice in embryo transfer. Some fertility specialists believe that without public funding, multiple embryos will continue to be implanted. Do funding issues determine best medical practice in a profession that aims first to do no harm?</P><P>The field of reproductive technology is highly specialized and can bring inestimable joy in helping people to create families. Nevertheless, standards are necessary and should be set by a committee that includes people conceived by these practices and a geneticist, developmental psychologist and neonatologist.</P><P>The Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons states that it values the privilege of self-regulation and working in a collegial, proactive manner with all external stakeholders.</P><P>When will they do so regarding IVF standards and guidelines?</P><P>Ultimately, and as the Canadian Supreme Court has ruled, provincial and territorial legislatures have jurisdiction to regulate assisted human reproduction. The Alberta government should ensure that, in all the decisions respecting the use of assisted human re-production, the health and well-being of children born through the application of assisted human reproductive technologies are given highest priority.</P><P>Juliet Guichon is a senior associate in the Office of Medical Bioethics and Ian Mitchell is a professor of pediatrics.
