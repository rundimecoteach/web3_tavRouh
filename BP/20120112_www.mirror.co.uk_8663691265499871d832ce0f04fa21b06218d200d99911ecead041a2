The mum of six was initially given a 50% chance of survival. But further tests revealed there was no trace of any other cancer.</P><DIV class="inline-ad span-16 last"><DIV class="caption">Advertisement &gt;&gt; </DIV></DIV><P>Doctors believe the tumour grew on a stalk at the back of her throat and the coughing dislodged it.</P><P>Claire said: “The consultant said: ‘It appears you have coughed up your cancer. Congratulations.’ I was totally flabbergasted, a coughing fit had saved my life.”</P><P>Claire felt a scratching sensation in her throat on October 11 last year and after five minutes’ coughing, she felt “something dislodge” and fly out of her mouth.</P><P>She said: “It looked like a strip of liver. I threw it away. The next day the same thing happened but this time the lump was much bigger. I knew something was very wrong so I went straight to my GP who sent the tissue sample away for tests.”</P><P>Claire and husband Kevin, 53, of Coventry, went on holiday and medics confirmed the sample was malignant on their return.</P><P>She said: “I was devastated. I just thought I was going to die so I started saving for my funeral.”</P><P>But a scan at University Hospital Coventry came back negative. She needed only a minor operation to remove cancerous tongue cells.</P><P>Her surgeon Gary Walton said: “It is very uncommon to cough up cancer, but she did it.”</P></DIV></TM:CONTENTOBJECT></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
