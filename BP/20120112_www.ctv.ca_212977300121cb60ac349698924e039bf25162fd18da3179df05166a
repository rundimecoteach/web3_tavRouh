He's trying everything possible to beat this disease.&quot;</P><P>In November 2011, Robin - who is a teetotal vegan - revealed details on his battle with liver cancer, which was diagnosed in April.</P><P>At the time, he said: &quot;I have been very unwell and am now on the road to recovery, and your prayers and wishes are a great tonic to me. I believe because of you I will get well and my deepest love goes out to you all.&quot;</P><P>The diagnosis came as a massive blow to Robin after he thought &quot;everything had gone back to normal&quot; following his successful treatment for an intestinal blockage in 2010.</P><P>Speaking of the ordeal, he explained: &quot;All this time I'd thought it was wind cramps. But the surgeon said that was typical of the way it manifests. The blockage was so bad that he was surprised it hadn't burst the day before, but it was too dangerous to delay any longer.</P><P>&quot;The relief was enormous, and afterwards I needed no painkillers. Not even an aspirin. I have a vegetarian diet, and a great appetite. Everything seemed to go back to normal.&quot;</P></DIV><DIV class="keyTool"><DIV class="toolBottom"><H2>User Tools</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
