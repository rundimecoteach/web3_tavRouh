HarperCollins and backed by the National Literacy Trust, will see McDonald's hand out nine 
million copies of Morpurgo's Mudpuddle Farm series.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">In the past, McDonald's gave away toys, often linked to children’s films, to encourage children to eat its Happy Meals.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">However, children’s food and health campaigners </FONT><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;"> accused the U.S. food chain of adopting a cynical marketing ploy.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">They are questioning whether the tie-up with burgers, fries and chicken nuggets is the best way to get children reading.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Mr Morpurgo is something of a hero to the nation’s children. His books are hugely popular and he spends a lot of his time touring schools to encourage a love of reading.</FONT></P><DIV class="relatedItemsTopBorder"> </DIV><DIV class="relatedItems"><H4>More...</H4><UL><LI><A href="/health/article-2084874/Study-finds-babies-fed-formula-milk-easier-to-sleep.html">Is breast really best?

McDonald’s has been criticised in the past for using toys to promote Happy Meals, it seems they have moved to the next most acceptable thing, which is books for children.’</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">The McDonald’s Happy Meal promotion will include six titles from the Mudpuddle Farm series, aimed at younger readers: Mossop’s Last Chance; Albertine, Goose Queen; Pigs Might Fly!; Jigger’s Day Off; Martians at Mudpuddle Farm; Mum’s the Word. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Some nine million of the books, which will also be available to purchase at McDonald’s restaurants without the need to buy a meal, will be distributed.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">McDonald's said the move was driven by research released by the National Literacy Trust in December which revealed that almost four million children in Britain – one in three – do not own a book.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Director of the Trust, Jonathan Douglas, said: ‘Our recent research showed that one in three children in this country don’t own a book, which is extremely concerning as there is a clear link between book ownership and children's future success in life. </FONT></P><DIV class="thinCenter"><P class="imageCaption">High profile: Mr Morpurgo's book War Horse has just been adapted for the big screen by Hollywood legend Steven Spielberg</P></DIV><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">‘We are very supportive of McDonald’s decision to give families access to popular books, as its size and scale will be a huge leap towards encouraging more families to read together.’</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Publisher at HarperCollins Children’s Books, Ann-Janine Murtagh, said: ‘We are delighted to be offering mums, dads and children the chance to enjoy books when they visit McDonald’s. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">‘We hope it will provide a great experience of reading together and also introduce them to the wonderful world of stories by inspiring authors such as the marvellous Michael Morpurgo. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">‘There are so many fantastic children’s books available today that we feel sure this promotion will encourage families to go on and discover more books and the huge fun to be had in reading.’</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Neither McDonald’s nor HarperCollins was able to provide a comment from Mr Morpurgo to confirm his enthusiasm for the scheme.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">McDonald’s put forward reality TV’s Jeff Brazier, who had two children with Jade Goody, as a spokesman for the scheme.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">He said: ‘Reading was a big part of my childhood. A real treat for me was sitting down with football annuals and comic books that I'd bought with my granddad. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">‘Knowing what a head start it gave me, I now try to read as much as I can with my boys. Reading to them at bedtime is the perfect end to their day.’</FONT></P><DIV class="clear"> </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
