They could be used to build an artificial artery in a test tube or the stem cells could be injected straight into the heart and they could form within it.’</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">A biotechnology firm in California managed to grow whole blood vessels in a lab for the first time last June and implanted them into three kidney dialysis patients.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">But the Cambridge team say they are the first to grow multiple types which could have more medical uses.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Dr Sinha added: ‘One type of blood vessel will be not suitable for everything.</FONT></P><DIV class="thinFloatRHS"><P class="imageCaption">Heart attack: Cambridge University research could revolutionise the way patients are treated after a cardiac arrest</P></DIV><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">‘We are looking at making arteries and now we have the tools to engineer all different types of blood vessels which are appropriate for each patient.’</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">They said their technique was 90 per cent effective in tests and would be suitable for producing blood vessels on an industrial scale, according to the study published in Nature Biotechnology.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Unlike some previous attempts to build veins the new technique does not need plasma – usually taken from animals which can contain chemicals toxic to humans. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Therefore the method has few health risks and a lower likelihood of being rejected by the patient’s body, Dr Sinha said.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">His team is ‘particularly excited’ about the hope it could offer adults and children with genetic disorders that degenerate the blood vessels, such as Marfan syndrome which affects around 10,000 Britons.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Their method could be used to grow the cells with the genetic abnormality in a lab for the first time – and then test out ways to treat them.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">About 12 per cent of the UK population are diagnosed with heart or circulatory disorders and the number of coronary bypass operations per year is more than 28,000. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Bypass surgery circumvents blocked arteries in the heart and body, often using a blood vessel from another part of the patient’s body. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Sometimes there is not a suitable blood vessel and doctors can use a synthetic one but these become clogged easily and can cause serious infections.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Professor Jeremy Pearson, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘This is very technologically advanced as they have managed to grow more types of cells and there is the potential to scale it up. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">‘Growing blood vessels would mean they could be used off-the-shelf and put into patients who need bypasses in the leg and the heart which is currently done using their own veins. It could potentially help heart attack patients as well.’</FONT></P><DIV class="clear"> </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
