After intervention, 57 per cent in canola group and 66 per cent in olive group showed no liver fat. This is statistically significant,” Anoop Misra, a former professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences who is now associated with Fortis Hospital, said.Misra along with colleagues from Command Hospital, Bangalore, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in Delhi, Government MH College of Home Science and Science for Women in Jabalpur and AIIMS conducted the research, which later would also look into the genetics of liver fat in Indians.The participants in the study were made to use olive and canola – supplied by a business house that funded the research – for six months and followed up in the next six months. Olive Pomace oil, which has higher heating point and good for Indian style cooking, was used.As many as 80 per cent obese have excess liver fat, which is dangerous as it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer, while 15 to 20 per cent non-obese persons also has liver fat. The excess fat could trigger heart attack, stroke and diabetes.Even though canola and olive are expensive, the health benefits come from healthy mono-unsaturated fatty acid, which these oils have aplenty. Canola has good quantity of omega-3 fatty acid too, which is good for heart.Misra made it clear that the new trial is not for categorising cooking oils on the basis of its health benefits and common Indian oils like mustard and rice barn oils too have their own advantages. The worst, however, is coconut oil, palm oil and butter fat. “It is best to use a combination of cooking oils in a limited quantity,” he said.</P></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
