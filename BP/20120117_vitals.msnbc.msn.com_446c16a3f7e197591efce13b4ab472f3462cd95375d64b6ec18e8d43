Chris  Hrouda</A>, executive vice president of Biomedical Services for the Red Cross. They describe a blood collection system plagued with poorly trained staff and inadequate record-keeping where donated blood was mishandled or misplaced and, in some cases, potentially infected blood was transfused into patients.</P><P align="left">“ARC has known of these continuing problems and has failed to take adequate steps to correct them,” wrote Evelyn Bonnin, director of FDA’s Baltimore District.</P><P align="left">But a Red Cross spokeswoman said in a statement that the problems primarily centered on an inspection at a Philadelphia site conducted 15 months ago and that the agency has since addressed many of the issues.</P><P align="left">“We are disappointed that the FDA believed it necessary to impose a fine for an inspection conducted so long ago,” wrote Stephanie Millian, director of biomedical communications. “We are not aware of any adverse donor reactions or patient issues due to the problems in the FDA report.”</P><P align="left">The latest fine, however, follows a $16 million fine in June 2010 for similar failures and caps nearly two decades of trouble at the Red Cross.  </P><P align="left">About 17 million units of blood are donated each year and about 15 million units are transfused, according to a 2009 survey conducted by AABB, an international association of blood products groups.The Red Cross has been operating under terms of a consent decree first issued in 1993 and then amended in 2003 to allow the FDA to impose stiff fines for ongoing failures to meet regulations and laws governing quality and safety of the nation’s blood supply. The problems detected then were the same ones that have not, apparently, been addressed now: overworked staff, sloppy clinical practices and inadequate record-keeping.</P><DIV class="vine-p vine_data_M2_LayoutPrinter vine_data_M2_FlexiblePrinter base_printer_widgets_AdBreak"><DIV class="adbreak"><DIV class="vine-p vine_data_M2_LayoutPrinter vine_data_M2_FlexiblePrinter base_printer_widgets_InsertAd"><DIV class="insertAd_Rectangle"><DIV class="newsvinemsn_adtype" style="height:250px; width=300px;"><DIV class="adlabel">advertisement</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="insertAd_CAB"><DIV class="newsvinemsn_adtype" style="height:250px; width=300px;"><DIV class="adlabel">advertisement</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P align="left">Despite repeated stiff fines and even the informal threat of criminal penalties from some FDA officials, the agency has not succeeded in improving its record, the latest sanctions demonstrate.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
