Down has been given the green light today as it poses little threat to marine life, a report has found. Seals or porpoises have not been affected either.</P><P>The SeaGen, the worlds largest commercial tidal energy generator, is capable of producing enough clean power for 1,500 homes in the area.</P><P>Originally installed in 2008, SeaGen operates by a two-blade rotary system that turns 14 times per minute.</P><P>Until now, SeaGen has only operated in daylight hours but today’s news could give the all-clear for night time usage also.</P><P>Environment Minister Alex Attwood spoke positively of the news saying: “Marine Current Turbines has proved that the power of the seas can be harnessed in harmony with marine life.</P><P>“The results of their work will give everyone greater confidence in realising the economic and environmental benefits that tidal and wave energy can offer to Northern Ireland, elsewhere in the UK and Ireland as well as other parts of the world.”</P><P>SeaGen was built at the historic Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
