Mike Bossley.</P><P>“You never know what is in your drug: yesterday, it was MDMA, today, it’s PMMA, and tomorrow, it could be something else. There is no safe street drug, and no safe dose of a street drug,” he said.</P><P>Dr. Mark Yarema, medical director of the province’s Poison and Drug Information Service (PADIS), said while they can look similar, there are important differences between ecstasy and methamphetamine.</P><P>“Although all have toxic effects, PMMA is considered more toxic than MDMA, with a higher incidence of seizures and elevated body temperature.”</P><P>Methamphetamine can also be slower to act, prompting users to take several tablets to get the desired effect, he said.</P><P>Police are still investigating the source of the drugs taken in each of the deaths.
