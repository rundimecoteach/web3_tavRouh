We want to make it a proactive opportunity to look at safety.&quot;</P><P>He said the move should not be interpreted as an attack on the industry.</P><P>&quot;I hope they will see it... as a real opportunity to get rigorous standard-setting and reporting,&quot; Mr Lansley said.</P><P>It follows significant fears some silicone implants could be at risk of rupture after French firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) was closed down for using materials designed for use in mattresses.</P><P>Around 40,000 women in Britain are believed to be affected and many wish to get the silicone removed.</P><P>However, there has been a mixed response from the cosmetic surgery industry. The Harvey Medical Group, for example, has said it will not replace PIP implants free of charge.</P><P>In Parliament earlier, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the Government had let down women who feared their implants were unsafe.</P><P>Many of those who had the operations privately have struggled to gain access to their medical records, have faced lengthy delays or &quot;hit a brick wall&quot;, he said.</P><P>Mr Lansley said the NHS would be there for women who find their private clinic refuses to remove faulty implants.</P><DIV class="articleImage"><P class="imageCaption">The Poly Implant Prothese implants that sparked concern</P></DIV><P>&quot;Any NHS service in this instance would only cover the removal of the implant, it would not include the replacement of private cosmetic implants,&quot; he said.</P><P>&quot;In these cases the Government would pursue private clinics to seek recovery of our costs.&quot;</P><P>Mr Lansley said it would not be fair for the taxpayer &quot;to foot the bill&quot; for patients who went private.</P><P>When the review into all procedures was announced, Sir Bruce said his priority was to ensure the safety of people who undergo cosmetic surgery.</P><P>&quot;The vast majority of practitioners in the cosmetic industry are professional and well skilled - but I'm concerned that the sector as a whole does not have the systems for monitoring the results for patients and alerting us to possible problems.</P><P>&quot;I will work with the industry to improve regulation and governance and increase consumer confidence,&quot; he added.</P><P>Market analysts <A href="http://www.mintel.com/" title="Read more about Mintel" target="_blank"><B>Mintel</B></A> estimates that in 2010 there were 101,904 surgical procedures and 1,250,919 non-surgical procedures carried out in the UK.</P><P>But this does not include privately-held &quot;botox parties&quot;.</P><P>The same year the market was worth £2.3bn and is expected to grow to £3.6bn in 2015.</P></DIV></DIV><A name="comments"> </A></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
