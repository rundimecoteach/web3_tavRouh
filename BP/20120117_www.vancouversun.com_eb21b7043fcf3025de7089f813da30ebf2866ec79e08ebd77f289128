If there are pockets [where it happens], and there are particularly some provinces [where] this is being practised, or there is good documentation or understanding, that requires a much higher level of scrutiny.&quot;</P><P>Dr. Shelly Ross, an obstetrician and international liaison for the FMWC, said it is not likely the policy would have any effect on the practice of feticide. &quot;The rules, at least in B.C., are that we don't tell them for 20 weeks,&quot; Ross said. &quot;But I find that in this modern day and age, if we say, 'No, we're not going to tell you,' [the patients] will go out to the private [doc-tor] and find out themselves.&quot;</P><P>Ross stressed the organization is wholly against feticide, but she doesn't feel extending the current time frame for keeping the gender secret would make any difference.</P><P>In an interview, Kale said 30 weeks was picked as an approximate time to start providing mothers information on their fetus's sex because, after that point, it would be difficult for anyone to get an abortion with-out a good medical reason for doing so.</P><DIV class="copyright">Â© Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun</DIV></DIV><DIV class="clear">Â </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
