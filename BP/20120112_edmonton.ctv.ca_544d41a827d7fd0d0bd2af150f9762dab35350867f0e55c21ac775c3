CTVNews.ca Staff</P><P>An appetite-suppressing hormone produced by the body that is used to treat type 2 diabetes can lead to weight loss in overweight or obese patients, says a new study. </P><P>The research, published Tuesday at bmj.com, also found that glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, reduces blood pressure and cholesterol levels. </P><P>GLP-1 is a hormone secreted by the gut when we eat. </P><P>A form of GLP-1 that is injected has emerged as a new treatment for type 2 diabetes for its ability to regulate blood-sugar levels. </P><P>But researchers have now found that the hormone can help with weight loss by curbing the appetite, thereby reducing food intake. </P><P>The Danish study, which included data from 6,000 patients who took part in 25 randomized controlled trials, found that in addition to lowering blood pressure and cholesterol -- as well as regulating blood sugar -- GSP-1 also helped with weight loss. Study subjects lost up to eight pounds over a four-month period. </P><P>While both patients with and without type 2 diabetes lost weight, the weight loss was more pronounced in patients without the disease. </P><P>&quot;We see a sustained effect on body weight throughout the trials, 25 trials,&quot; researcher Dr. Tina Vilsboll, head of diabetes research at the University of Copenhagen, told CTV News. &quot;So it is not just a coincidence, it is efficacious on body weight.&quot; </P><P>The findings are especially significant because other diabetes medications often cause patients to gain, rather than lose, weight.</P><P>The researchers write that further study is needed to determine if GLP-1, which costs about $400 per month, should be prescribed for overweight or obese patients without type 2 diabetes. </P><P>According to Vilsboll, researchers will know within the next two to three years if GLP-1 can be more widely prescribed solely as weight-loss treatment. </P><P>The study has led some experts to urge caution, however. </P><P>In an accompanying editorial, obesity specialist Dr. Raj Padwal of the University of Alberta points out that the weight loss was modest. </P><P>As well, the hormone can produce side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, and comes with a possible risk of damage to the pancreas and the thyroid. </P><P>&quot;While these results highlight the weight-reducing benefits, they should not alter current practice,&quot; Padwal wrote. </P><P>According to Padwal, &quot;modification of diet and lifestyle remains the cornerstone of the treatment of type 2 diabetes.&quot; </P><P>Vilsboll said the hormone is not a cure for type 2 diabetes. However, combined with lifestyle changes, it could have a major impact on the health of patients. </P><P>Dr. Ravi Retnakaran of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital is also studying the hormone, and says the research &quot;is an encouraging sign because weight control is an important part of the management of diabetes.&quot; </P><P><EM>With a report from CTV medical specialist Avis Favaro and producer Elizabeth St. Philip</EM></P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="mainTableMiddle"><DIV id="VideoPlayer"><DIV id="topSectionVideo" style="height:17px;background-image:url(http://www.ctv.ca/mar/images/local990/broadbandgreyTop.jpg);background-repeat:no-repeat"><DIV style="font-weight:bold; padding-top: 3px">CTV NEWS VIDEO PLAYER</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
