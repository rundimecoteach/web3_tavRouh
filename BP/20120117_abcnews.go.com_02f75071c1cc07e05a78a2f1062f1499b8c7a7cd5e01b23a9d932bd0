How will anyone be able to pay these ridiculous bills? More and more are uninsured because their companies cannot afford healthcare and those that have it find that it is unsatisfactory in many ways. Co-insurance and deductibles are squeezing consumers who can barely afford their mortgages or rents let alone $3,000 and up yearly deductibles. Romney wants to appeal Obamacare but premiums will end up going up 25% in that case. The free market is clearly not a solution and healthcare is quickly becoming rationed. The US is broke. We need to do something quickly.</P></DIV><P class="author-info">

This amounts to a company’s recklessness manifested in many levels of management – for one – It appeared that the company hired poor-quality software engineer(s) and the embarrassing result shown in media limelight. And I know what I’m talking about because I’ve more than 30 years of programming and working experience to back it up.</P></DIV><P class="author-info">

I have written medical form software in the past.  Medical forms in software need to be beyond bullet-proof and the QA team needs to try as many crazy combinations or errors as possible.  Even then, sometimes bad data passes through the software to the system.  One example was when a health insurance client asked why there was apparently unrelated text in the notes field of a medical form.  The problem was that the agent copy and pasted an Olive Garden recipe from a web browser into the notes field in the medical form.  Since the client asked about the details of the text and the recipe was incomplete, I sent the URL to the recipe and the full description of the recipe to the client.  :-)</P></DIV><P class="author-info">

I have heard of more and more companies overbilling, and then apologizing and setting the bill right after being “caught.”  There has to be a number of others, probably elderly, who don’t notice the change, and end up paying the amount.  This could be yet one more way of deceiving the public to boost income.  It could be yet one more scheme to defraud the public without anyone watching, without any consequences.</P></DIV><P class="author-info">
