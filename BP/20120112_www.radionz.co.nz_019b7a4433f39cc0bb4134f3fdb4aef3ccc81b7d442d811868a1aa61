She says an obesity commissioner should be appointed.</P><P>New Zealand ranks third highest in the developed world for obesity, according to the OECD, with nearly two-thirds of adults considered overweight or obese, the study said.</P><H3>Labour defends record</H3><P>The Labour Party is defending its record on public health following the release of the study's findings.</P><DIV class="image right third"><P class="caption">Grant Robertson. </P><P class="photocred">PHOTO: LABOUR PARTY</P></DIV><P>Deputy leader Grant Robertson rejects the suggestion that his party sided with food companies, saying it tried to stop the surge in obesity by banning schools from selling junk food and this was later overturned by the National-led Government.</P><P>However, Health Minister Tony Ryall says the Government trusts parents and schools to decide what should go in school lunches.</P><P>Mr Robertson also rejects the study's recommendation that the food industry needs to be governed by an independent regulator.</P><P>&quot;We need to make sure that as much as possible it is done via self-regulation, because that's the way that is most efficient.</P><P>&quot;But clearly, the sector is also one that needs regulation from government - and that needs to be looked at from time to time.</P><P>&quot;The Labour Party will continue to look at policies that are about regulation and get the balance right.&quot;</P><P>Mr Robertson says reducing obesity rates is the responsibility of individuals and the Government.</P><P class="copyright">Copyright © 2012, Radio New Zealand</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="cont-sec"><DIV class="whaabout"><H3>Top Stories</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
