Eat from a red plate and drink from a red cup, recommends a new study. German and Swiss academics claim that using a red plate stops people from eating as much food and using red cups also stops pub-goers from drinking too much alcohol - in fact, it helps reduce food and drinks consumption by 40%.</P><P> They said the colour red may encourage diners to avoid snacking because it is commonly associated with the idea of &quot;danger, prohibition and stop&quot; , the Daily Mail reported.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="mod-a-body-after-first-para" style="" class="mod-timesofindiaarticletextwithadcpc mod-timesofindiaarticletext mod-articletext"><P> The findings mean the government and food industry could start using red packaging on unhealthy foods as a deterrent - and could even use more red in pubs to prevent people drinking too much.</P><P> For the study, researchers recruited 41 male students who were asked to drink tea from cups marked with red or blue labels. The subjects drank 44% less from cups with red labels.</P><P> In the second part, 109 people were given 10 pretzels each on either a red, blue or white plate. Those with a red plate ate fewer pretzels, say the researchers .
