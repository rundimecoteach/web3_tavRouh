            </H1><DIV class="editorialSectionLeft"><DIV class="byline"><P><SPAN>Published on <STRONG class="pubDate">Wednesday 11 January 2012 16:22</STRONG></SPAN></P></DIV><P>THE identity of the island’s new breast care surgeon has been revealed.</P><P>Ms Millie Bello will take on the permanent post as of February 1 and brings with her impeccable credentials and a massive amount of expertise in the area.</P><P>Ms Bello’s official title is consultant general surgeon with a special interest in oncoplastic breast surgery and breast care. In reality this means she is a breast care specialist who will be able to develop the island’s breast care service while providing vital general surgery on-call cover.</P><P>Her appointment, plus plans to develop the service, means many women who would have had to travel off-island for treatment will no longer have to do so. She and her team at Noble’s Hospital will be charged with offering a wider range of enchanced services on-island, including oncoplastic breast surgery, sentinel node biopsy, immediate and delayed breast reconstruction, symmetrisation surgery and aesthetic breast reconstruction.</P><P>Ms Bello, who has been a consultant general surgeon with a special interest in breast surgery for 10 years in the UK, has spent the last six-and-a-half years working at Nottingham University Hospital’s Breast Institute, a centre of excellence in the provision of breast care services.</P><P>‘I am very excited about coming to the Isle of Man,’ she said. ‘I’ve already made a number of visits and the island offers an excellent quality of life. The community seems very friendly and I’ve already been made to feel welcome. I’m very much looking forward to working with colleagues to develop the island’s breast care service, ensuring that patients receive the highest standard of care possible.’</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
