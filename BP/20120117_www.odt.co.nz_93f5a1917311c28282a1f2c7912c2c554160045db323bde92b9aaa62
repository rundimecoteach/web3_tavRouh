      Hospital emergency department specialist says Southern
      District Health Board management appear to have backtracked
      on recruiting an extra 4.5 senior medical officers for the
      department.
    </P><P>
      However, yesterday board chairman Joe Butterfield said the
      extra staffing proposal was still a work in progress, and no
      decisions had been made.
    </P><P>
      In the public-excluded session of its July meeting, the board
      approved the ED observation unit business case, which
      included $1.779 million extra for ED staffing in the first
      year, and $1.695 million in the second year. However, it was
      subject to budgetary constraints.
    </P><P>
      Mr Butterfield was unable to clarify whether those figures
      solely related to the possible extra SMOs.
    </P><P>
      Dr John Chambers, also an Association of Salaried Medical
      Specialists union representative, believed the board approved
      the additional top staff, but management stopped it,
      seemingly because of lack of funds.
    </P><P>
      Word of the significant extra SMOs was welcomed by senior
      staff, who prepared rosters factoring in the additional
      resource.
    </P><P>
      After preparing the rosters the doctors were advised the
      extra staff were no longer a top priority.
    </P><P>
      &quot;It seems to be back to the drawing board.
    </P><P>
      &quot;My colleagues spent quite a few months developing rosters to
      make the best use of the increase in staff to improve our
      staffing at the weekends in particular.&quot;
    </P><P>
      There seemed to be a disconnection between the board's
      expectations, and what management subsequently decided, he
      said.
    </P><P>
      Dunedin would not have had trouble attracting the
      specialists, who had been expected to take up the posts this
      year.
    </P><P>
      &quot;We have capable young specialists who would love to come and
      work in Dunedin.&quot;
    </P><P>
      Instead, the department was to get an additional 0.6 SMO, a
      position that might not be easy to fill as it was not
      full-time.
    </P><P>
      &quot;Young doctors want a full-time position.&quot;
    </P><P>
      The department had 7.6 SMOs; it should have 12 to 13,
      according to professional guidelines, Dr Chambers said.
    </P><P>
      The recent appointment of two senior registrars was positive,
      and they could fill in as senior medical officers, although
      only with supervision. However, the pair worked half of their
      hours in anaesthetics.
    </P><P>
      It was disappointing for doctors keenly following
      recommendations made by the National Health Board and other
      parties for hospital improvements, for which there seemed to
      be no money.
    </P><P>
      It was hoped the specialists would be in place in time for
      the new observation ward, which is to open in the middle of
      the year.
    </P><P>
      Chief operating officer (Otago) Vivian Blake said the
      proposal approved in the middle of last year had not
      specified the extra staff, and was part of a wider business
      case for the ED observation unit.
    </P><P>
      &quot;We haven't got any additional money to put to additional
      staffing.&quot;
    </P><P>
      Instead, rosters were being rearranged to make better use of
      existing staff.
    </P><P>
      &quot;At the moment, we have a mismatch of [specialist] rosters to
      [patient] attendances.&quot;
    </P><P>
      Doctors at Southland Hospital had also requested an increase
      in ED staff, and the DHB was taking a district-wide approach
      to the problem.
    </P><P>
      The Otago and Southland chief medical officers, Richard
      Bunton and Dr David Tulloch, were arranging meetings with ED
      doctors in both Invercargill and Dunedin.
    </P><P>
      In an email obtained by the <I>Otago Daily Times</I>, Mrs
      Blake advised a colleague there was no money &quot;coming our way
      via the NHB for this or anything else&quot;.
    </P><P>
      &quot;The first thing to consider is whether this request for
      additional FTE is the highest organisational priority ... If
      it is agreed that ED is the highest priority, I suggest you
      look at whether there is a vacant [senior medical officer] in
      the system that can be realigned.&quot;
