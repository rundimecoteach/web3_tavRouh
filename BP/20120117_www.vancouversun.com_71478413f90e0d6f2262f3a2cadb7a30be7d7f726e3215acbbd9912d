That they can reduce these inspectors and safety programs and no one will notice. Something terrible happened to me and my family. We're not special. If the federal government does not maintain adequate safety oversight and inspection it could happen again to anyone's family.&quot;</P><P>Kingston said CFIA is also anticipating up to a 10 per cent cut to its overall budget in 2012-13 as part of the government's strategic and operating review. The details will be announced in the upcoming federal budget.</P><P>A 10 per cent reduction would translate to an additional cut of about $74 million, shrinking CFIA funding to a level found below the listeriosis outbreak of August 2008, said Kingston.</P><P>&quot;If Ottawa proceeds with the cuts it has already announced, plus another 10 per cent, the federal government will be playing roulette with the health of Canadians.&quot;</P><P>Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz, who is in charge of CFIA, dismissed Kingston's &quot;union tactics,&quot; saying the &quot;facts are clear.&quot;</P><P>Since the outbreak, the government announced $75 million to implement the recommendations of independent investigator Sheila Weatherill, appointed to probe what went wrong in Canada's meat inspection system.</P><P>Meanwhile, Budget 2010 announced $13 million annually for two years to increase meat inspection capacity. Budget 2011 announced $100 million over five years to invest in inspection training, tools and technology and science capacity, with $18 million flowing to CFIA in the first two years.</P><P>&quot;Our government has made real and significant investments to ensure the safety of Canada's food supply,&quot; Ritz said in a statement.</P><P>Ritz's office did not comment specifically on the question of the sunset of funding for bolstered inspection frequency, outlined in CFIA's 2011-12 plan and priorities report.</P><P>NDP food safety critic Malcolm Allen called on the government to make sure the cuts don't happen.</P><P>&quot;I strongly urge this government to reconsider these cuts and provide CFIA the resources it needs to ensure the food Canadian families are putting on their dinner table is safe,&quot; said Allen.</P><P>sschmidt@postmedia.com</P><DIV class="copyright">Â© Copyright (c) Postmedia News</DIV></DIV><DIV class="clear">Â </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
