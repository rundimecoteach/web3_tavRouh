  most seeing their partner as only 69 per cent perfect.

Common faults that mean men miss the mark included watching too much sport and 
  poor personal grooming. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="secondPar"><P>
Bathroom habits such as leaving the toilet door open were also cited by women 
  taking part in the survey as a frequent failing. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="thirdPar"><P>
The poll of 2,000 women showed more than 75 per cent believed the perfect man 
  did not exist. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="fourthPar"><P>
Other shortcomings were an inability to multi-task, criticising their 
  partner's driving and not getting along with her family. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="fifthPar"><P>
Nikki McReynolds, marketing director for Remington which commissioned the 
  research, said: &quot;It seems that women are actually quite realistic on 
  what they look for from their partner.

 &quot;While they might happily overlook a few common flaws from their guys, 
  there are certain behaviours that men just won't get away with.&quot; 
</P><P>
The results showed one in five women think their partner only pretends to 
  listen to them while leaving clothes on the bedroom floor and snoring were 
  among other gripes. 
</P><P>
The perfect man would be expected to make an effort with his partner's 
  friends, avoid using her toothbrush, stay clean-shaven and not be lazy. 
</P><P>
But above all, 35 per cent of women rate a good personality as most important 
  with sense of humour the top quality for a quarter of respondents. 
</P><P>
Footballer David Beckham came top in the poll of perfect celebrity man, while 
  chef Gordon Ramsay ranked near the bottom. 
</P><P>
Miss McReynolds added: &quot;It's clear that while guys may not be completely 
  perfect, there are plenty of things they can be perfect in, in order to 
  please their partner. 
</P><P>
 &quot;As long as guys take the time to look after themselves, be attentive 
  and keep up appearances then their partner will be willing to overlook the 
  smaller pet peeves. 
</P><P>
 &quot;The average guy may not be able to compete with the image of a David 
  Beckham, and their partners don't expect them to â€“ but there are still a 
  number of small changes they can do to make a big difference.&quot;
