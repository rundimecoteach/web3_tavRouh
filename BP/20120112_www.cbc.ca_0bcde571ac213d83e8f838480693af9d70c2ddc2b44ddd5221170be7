The freezing weather caused the crane hydraulics to act up, seizing the equipment. Workers had to use a torch to heat it up to get it moving again.</P><P>Then the wrecking ball fell off inside the building. No one was hurt and it was finally reattached but the work was significantly delayed through the morning.</P><P>The century-old Maryland South building is being demolished as part of the $43-million redevelopment project.</P><P>A new two-storey health complex will be constructed in its place.</P><P>When the work is complete, Misericordia will be home to the province's eye care &quot;centre of excellence&quot; and will also house a new diagnostic imaging centre, a chronic care unit, a sleep lab clinic and renal dialysis centre</P><P>The centre will also introduce a &quot;program of integrated managed-care for the elderly,&quot; or PRIME, that will combine medical and nursing care with leisure activities and family respite.</P></DIV><DIV id="storytools" class="wrap8 clearfix sclt-share"><H3 class="metanav">Share Tools</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
