Dr. Jerry Strauss provides a wide range of dental treatments, including general, sedation, and <A href="http://www.aestheticdentalcarenj.com/">cosmetic dentistry in New Jersey</A>. He says sedation dentistry allows his patients to relax, which in turn helps create positive dental experiences and safe, effective results. When choosing a sedation dentistry practice, Dr. Strauss recommends discussing all available options for sedation, as well as the dentist's experience with each procedure.</P><P>Also commonly referred to as <A href="http://www.aestheticdentalcarenj.com/sedation-dentistry/">sleep dentistry</A>, Dr. Strauss says the name can be misleading as the patient actually remains conscious throughout the entire procedure. The purpose of sedation dentistry according to Dr. Strauss is simply to put the patient in a state of relaxation to ensure they are not consumed by the fear they typically experience during dental treatment.</P><P>While intravenous sedation is the traditional method used for sedation dentistry, Dr. Strauss says less invasive methods are gaining in popularity, including inhalation sedation and oral sedation. Regardless of the method employed, Dr. Strauss says the dental procedure does not necessarily determine the type of sedation method. Instead, he stresses the need to address each individual treatment plan along with the specifics of a patient's case before deciding on the type of sedation.</P><P>Ultimately, Dr. Strauss says patients appreciate the sedation dentistry option at his practice because they do not have to feel the pain or experience anxiety associated with any number of the procedures he offers. However, Dr. Strauss says the main benefit of alleviating these concerns for his patients is the fact that it allows him and his staff to maintain the oral health of his patients. &quot;Fortunately, sedation techniques allow us to comfortably treat the true dental phobics, those people that have had bad experiences and have anxiety about dental treatment and even the medically compromised. I believe dental sedation is one of the real critical components to success in dentistry.&quot;</P><P>About Jerry Strauss, DMD</P><P><A href="https://profiles.google.com/jstraussdmd">Dr. Jerry Strauss</A> earned his dental degree from the Boston University School of Dentistry.
