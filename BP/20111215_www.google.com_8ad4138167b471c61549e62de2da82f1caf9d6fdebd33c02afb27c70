–<SPAN class="hn-date">2 days ago</SPAN> </P><P>GENEVA — Malaria caused the death of an estimated 655,000 people last year, with 86 percent of victims children aged under five, World Health Organisation figures showed on Tuesday.</P><P>The figure marked a five percent drop in deaths from 2009.</P><P>Africa accounted for 91 percent of deaths and 81 percent of the 216 million cases worldwide in 2010.</P><P>In its annual World Malaria Report for 2011, the WHO hailed as a &quot;major achievement&quot; a 26 percent fall in mortality rates since 2000 despite being well short of its 50 percent target.</P><P>The UN health agency aims to eradicate malaria deaths altogether by the end of 2015 and reduce the number of cases by 75 percent on 2000 levels.</P><P>International funding for the fight against malaria peaked at $2 billion (1.5 billion euros) this year but the WHO estimates $5 billion will be needed each year until 2015 if its targets are to be reached.</P><P>The cash has funded an big increase in the number of households with insecticide-treated mosquito nets, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where 50 percent now have the nets compared with just three percent in 2000.</P><P>To finance the fight, the WHO suggested a tax on financial transactions or the rolling out of a tax on airline journeys which it said, if extended to other countries, could generate significant extra funds.</P><P>&quot;Other country-specific schemes, such as tourist taxes, may offer opportunities to raise funds for control programmes in malaria endemic countries,&quot; the report said.</P><P>WHO director general Margaret Chan welcomed the &quot;significant and durable&quot; progress in the fight against malaria but said parasite resistance to drugs was causing concern in parts of South-east Asia.</P><P>&quot;Parasite resistance to antimalarial medicines remains a real and ever-present danger to our continued success,&quot; said Chan.</P><P>&quot;There is an urgent need to develop an Asia-wide framework to ensure sustained and coordinated action against this public health threat.&quot;</P><P>According to the WHO, malaria is endemic in 106 countries and is currently transmitted in 99 of them.</P><P>Of the 99, 43 recorded a fall in reported cases of more than 50 percent between 2000 and 2010.</P><P>Six countries account for 60 percent of deaths from Malaria: Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burkino Faso, Mozambique, Ivory Coast and Mali.</P><P>Europe had an estimated 176 cases of malaria in 2010 with no reported deaths.</P><DIV id="hn-links-header">On the Net:</DIV><P id="hn-distributor-copyright"><SPAN>Copyright ©  2011   AFP.
