            	    		        ‘Neurology timebomb’ will see 30%  surge in cases  of Parkinson’s

It also accused the Westminister government of having its “head in the sand”.</P><P>The alliance argues that services are being run in a “haphazard way” with no clear strategy in place, and billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money is potentially being wasted.</P><P>It follows a damning report in December from the National Audit Office (NAO) which found emergency hospital admissions for people with neurological conditions have risen by almost a third despite a huge government investment in services.</P><P>The study said while access to services had improved and waiting times had fallen, key areas of care had got worse.</P><P>In 2009-10, 14 per cent of people with Parkinson’s disease, MS and MND who were discharged from hospital after an overnight stay were readmitted within 28 days as an emergency.</P><P>People admitted as an emergency are also often treated by doctors and nurses with no neurological training, with evidence suggesting this worsens outcomes for patients.</P><P>Furthermore, the report found delays in diagnosis and treatment.</P><P>Steve Ford, chairman of the Neurological Alliance and chief executive of Parkinson’s UK, said: “The situation can only get worse. A crisis is looming but the government has its head in the sand.”</P><P>He added: “When it comes to helping vulnerable people with a neurological condition the government is floundering around in a fog of its own making. We need a leader to champion improvements – a neurology tsar, if you like – backed up with a plan and a strategy.</P><P>“When diabetes, cancer and stroke were assigned tsars, things really started to happen.</P><P>“People affected by neurological conditions are fed up with being at the bottom of the government’s ‘to do’ list.”</P><P>Mr Ford will give evidence to the Commons public accounts committee today in light of the NAO report.</P><P>Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the MS Society, added: “The government now needs to send a clear message to everyone living with a neurological condition that these services are a  priority.”</P><P>The estimated number of people who have MND in the UK is 4,200, but this is predicted to rise to 5,330 by 2020.</P><P>Around 100,000 people in the UK have MS.</P><P>A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Our top priority for people living with all neurological conditions is to ensure the Neurological Standards published by Healthcare Improvement Scotland are implemented – they offer the best mechanism for achieving safe, effective and person-centred care.</P><P>“The standards will help ensure people get the earliest and most appropriate treatment locally, but with access to specialist services when needed. That’s why we’ve provided boards with £1.2 million, to help take the standards forward.”</P><DIV id="relatedArticles"><H3>Related Articles</H3><UL><LI><H4><A href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/jinky_a_hero_remembered_1_485965">Jinky: a hero remembered</A></H4><P>LAST week, at the family home in Uddingston, Jimmy Johnstone received bad news.
