They brought back the suffering my parents experienced where poor hospital and care-home practice went unchallenged.</P><P>Too many hospital trusts and local authorities fail to learn lessons and acknowledge mistakes; so repetition is inevitable. In Mid Staffs, the &quot;silence from doctors and nurses&quot;, with few honourable exceptions, ensured that the desperate attempts to cut costs to become a foundation trust had fatal consequences. The &quot;shocking catalogue of appalling care&quot; you report at Mid Staffs was a microcosm of what the <A href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/nhs" title="More from guardian.co.uk on NHS">NHS</A> and <A href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/social-care" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Social care">social care</A> could become.</P><P>These are avoidable tragedies. Hospitals and social services inevitably make mistakes. Good organisations want to know about such mistakes and learn from them. But the CQC has utterly failed to challenge the widespread absence of a learning culture. Indeed, it failed to blow the whistle on its own underfunding, gagged its own whistleblowing inspectors, cut its inspections catastrophically by 70% between 2009 and 2011 and generally, as you state, had an &quot;unhealthy organisational culture&quot;.</P><P>Its astonishing litany of shortcomings is rooted in previous government funding cuts and the desire for more &quot;light touch&quot; regulation. Key NHS leaders remain in denial, despite the recent inquiries. Cynthia Bower of CQC claims &quot;we have learned, reviewed what we do and made changes&quot;, while Sue Slipman of the Foundation Trust Network claims the CQC's judgments are &quot;disproportionate&quot;. The CQC has indeed failed us all, but it is far from being the only culprit.</P><P>Health secretary Andrew Lansley, who rightly established the Mid Staffs inquiry, now presides over changes that will make another scandal more likely. You report that he &quot;has kept a close eye on proceedings&quot;, but the next such inquiry will undoubtedly conclude that his market-led NHS and huge cuts in health and social care budgets were the prime suspects, alongside the failure to protect whistleblowers. As someone who has represented victimised whistleblowers, I am not surprised the RCN reports that <A href="http://www.rcn.org.uk/newsevents/press_releases/uk/nurses_still_afraid_to_blow_the_whistle_-_rcn" title="">84% of nurses worry that they'd be victimised if they reported concerns about patient safety</A>, something the planned extension of the qualifying period for employment protection will make worse.</P><P>Yet there is also hope. Despite the immense obstacles, brave souls do raise concerns, often risking their careers. There is a powerful case for the inquiry to recommend strengthened statutory protection for whistleblowers and serious penalties for those who victimise them. Will Andrew Lansley endorse such a recommendation?</P><P>Health and social care organisations should be open learning organisations where those raising concerns are praised, not ignored or punished. All of us, individually and collectively, have a duty to ensure there are enough staff, treated fairly, and encouraged to raise concerns. Nothing less will do.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
