We're an innocent victim like everyone else, we're attempting to do our best for our patients.&quot;</P><P>Mr Lansley blamed PIP, the French manufacturer of the implants, which fooled regulators by hiding the cheap industrial silicone when inspectors came to visit.</P><P>But he announced further investigations into the the EU approval of the devices which resulted in them receiving a CE mark, the actions of the MHRA and reviews by NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh and the Care Quality Commission of the regulation of the cosmetic surgery industry.</P><P>Sources said Mr Lansley was dismayed at the response of the private clinics – Transform, a second private chain, has also refused to replace the implants at its own cost – and warned NHS waiting lists could rise as a result. Worried women who cannot get help from their private clinic have been told they can have the implants removed on the NHS.</P><P>A source said: &quot;The private clinics have a duty of care to their patients, they have made a lot of money and to leave women on their own is not good enough.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
