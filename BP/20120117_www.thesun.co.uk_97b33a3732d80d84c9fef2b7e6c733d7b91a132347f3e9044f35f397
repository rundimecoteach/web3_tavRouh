A SKIN serum hailed as the &quot;holy grail&quot; of anti-ageing started flying off the 
shelves yesterday.
</H2><P>
Forever Youth Liberator from Yves Saint Laurent had already racked up more 
than 5,000 pre-orders.
</P><P>
In a trial of 50 women, nine out of ten said their skin looked more luminous 
after using the lotion, while 72 per cent said fine lines were less visible.
</P><P>
The range contains synthetic versions of glycans, naturally occurring sugars 
in the skin.
</P><P>
Science writer and broadcaster Vivienne Parry says: &quot;Glycobiology is going to 
change the world in many areas and it is a very important development in 
skincare too.
</P><P>
&quot;Glycans are complicated sugars that play a key role in the structure of the 
skin.
</P><P>
&quot;They also sit on the surface of cells and transmit messages to them. Glycans 
reduce with age. These glycans can make skin cells act as they would have 
when in a younger body.&quot;
</P><P>
A study of the technique in the journal Technology Review in 2003 said the 
discovery was &quot;one of the ten emerging technologies that would change the 
world.&quot;
</P><P>
YSL worked with Professor Peter Seeberger, of Germany's Max Planck Institute, 
to develop the serum.
</P><P>
He said: &quot;I was surprised YSL was interested in my work. I'm interested in 
health, not face paint. Still, we were able to apply our existing techniques 
to glycans in skin.&quot;
</P><P>
But the search for eternal youth is not cheap. Just 30g — just more than two 
tablespoons of the serum — is <B>Ј50</B>.
</P><P>
Skincare wonder products are not new — and often cheaper.
</P><P>
Recent examples include Boots' No7 Protect &amp; Perfect Beauty Serum, 
which enjoyed a sales boost after being featured in a 2007 BBC documentary.
</P><P>
And in April 2008 there was a stampede to supermarket shelves as Waitrose's 
Baby Bottom Butter sold like hot cakes after parents recommended using the 
Ј2.54 cream on their faces too. 
</P><P>
Another cheap skin product which took the beauty world by surprise was 
supermarket Aldi's Ј3.49 Lacura Multi-Intensive Serum.
</P><P>
The Sun checked out what 30g of other luxury goods would cost you: 30g of 
sterling silver costs Ј17.34, 28g of Mottra Sterlet Sturgeon Caviar is Ј55 
from online supermarket Ocado and 30g of Fresh Black Winter Truffle is 
Ј63.95 from London Fine Foods Group.
