influenza. It was discovered in 1999, by Gilead Sciences, a Californian biotech
company set up by doctor Michael Riordan in 1987 and is manufactured by Roche.</FONT></P><P class="MsoNormal"><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">The influenza virus gets into the body through the mouth or
nose. It replicates itself in the cells lining the airways. The viruses then
spread to more and more cells making the infection more serious. </FONT></P><P class="MsoNormal"><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Tamiflu blocks the effects of a chemical called
neuraminidase that is made by the influenza virus, which it uses to spread. So
the sooner it is taken after symptoms develop the better the chance of warding
off the worst effects of flu.</FONT></P><P class="MsoNormal"><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">This makes it easier for the body's immune system to
clear-up the infection.</FONT></P><P class="MsoNormal"><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">It can cause side-effects, although not everyone will
experience them. </FONT></P><P class="MsoNormal"><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">'The most common ones are nausea, vomiting and stomach ache,'
says GP Wendy Denning of London's the Health Doctors clinic. 'Tamiflu should be
taken after food. However, if a person is sick within an hour of taking it, it
is likely to be ineffective.'</FONT></P><P class="MsoNormal"><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">Roche revised the Tamiflu patient information warning that
it can cause hallucinations, delirium or abnormal behaviour, which sometimes
'results in fatal outcomes'.</FONT></P><P class="MsoNormal"><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">This was after the Japanese government warned doctors in
March 2007 that Tamiflu should not be prescribed to teenagers for fear that it
can lead to bizarre and self-destructive behaviour, after investigating the
deaths of 18 Japanese children.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">The Swiss firm said it made full clinical study data available to health authorities as part of the licensing process.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">A spokesperson for Roche said today: 'Roche stands behind the robustness and integrity of our data supporting the efficacy and safety of Tamiflu.'</FONT></P><DIV class="thinCenter"><P class="imageCaption">Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche said they 'stand by the robustness and integrity of our data'</P></DIV><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'At the end of last year we published a major review of the scientific evidence base, which showed a clear benefit in offering antivirals to those with severe illness and those with additional risk factors.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size:1.2em;">'Our priority has always been to minimise the risk of serious illness and death from seasonal flu.'</FONT></P><DIV class="clear">Â </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
