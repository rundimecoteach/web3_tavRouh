10 or more sexual partners.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">The increase in sexual promiscuity among young adults is mirrored in a surge in tests for sexually-transmitted diseases.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Nearly half of young women (44 per cent) had been tested for the STI chlamydia, compared to 12 per cent of women aged 45 to 54. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">The same trend was seen in men, dropping from 27 per cent of men aged 16 to 24 to six per cent of the older group.</FONT></P><DIV class="relatedItemsTopBorder"> </DIV><DIV class="relatedItems"><H4>More...</H4><UL><LI><A href="/health/article-2074057/Obesity-crisis-primary-schools-11-year-olds-grossly-overweight.html">Obesity crisis in schools: How one child in three is too fat by the age of 11</A></LI></UL></DIV><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">However, at the other end of the scale 26 per cent of women and 32 per cent of men aged 16 to 24 said they were still virgins.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Across all age groups, men have typically had 9.3 female sexual partners in their lifetime, while women have slept with an average of 4.7 men.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Almost a quarter of all women (24 per cent) have only ever had one sexual partner, compared to 17 per cent of men.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Overall men are twice as likely to have had 10 or more partners of the opposite sex than women - with 27 per cent compared to 13 per cent.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">The survey included data from 8,420 adults and 5,692 children.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Shadow health minister Diane Abbott said: 'The rising numbers of girls having under-age sex is alarming.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">'It is not a cost-free phenomenon.
