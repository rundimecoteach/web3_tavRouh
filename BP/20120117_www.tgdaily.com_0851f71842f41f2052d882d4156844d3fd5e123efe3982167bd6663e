These conditions could favor the kind of gene swapping that creates new variations of the influenza virus, say the scientists.</P><P>More worryingly, changes in migration don't just alter the pattern of contact among bird species. They can also change the ways that birds come into contact with domestic animals such as pigs - and it was gene-swapping between avian and pig flu viruses that's believed to have triggered the 2009 swine flu pandemic.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
