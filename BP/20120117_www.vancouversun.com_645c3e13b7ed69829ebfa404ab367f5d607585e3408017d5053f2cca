They go to sleep.â</P><P>But the rats who were given alcohol plus DHM, showed no signs of intoxication, Liang said.</P><P>âThey donât (get) drunk,â said Liang. âIt was amazing. I was so excited.â</P><P>The rats in the alcohol group slept for about 70 minutes, while those in the DHM group only slept for about 10 minutes. Others didnât sleep at all, she said.  </P><P>In another test, the researchers administered DHM to rats who were given alcohol for a prolonged period of time. Their symptoms of alcohol dependency were significantly reduced.</P><P>âFrom this experiment, even if you establish a high drinking level of alcohol and then give them DHM, their dependence will reduce,â said Liang.</P><P>The rats given DHM along with alcohol did not have any hangover symptoms either, she said.</P><P>The next step, if she is able to secure enough funding, is to test the studyâs findings in human clinical trials, said Liang. </P><P>She expects to see the same results in humans, and without any negative side effects.</P><P>âFor more than 500 years (that hovenia has been used as a supplement), there have been no reports of poison or toxicity,â she said. âItâs really safe.â</P><P>Liangâs goal is to turn DHM into a medication, possibly in a gum, patch or spray-form, she said. She already has patented her idea.</P><P>Alcohol-use disorders are a major public-health problem around the world, said Liang.</P><P>In her study, she wrote that there are only three medications â oral naltrexone, acamprosate and disulfiram â currently approved for treating alcohol dependence by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</P><P>However, Liang said these drugs have major side-effects and have not been proven effective in treating the disorders. </P><P>Bernard Le Foll, a pharmacology professor at the University of Toronto, said the studyâs findings are âvery promisingâ for the treatment of alcohol addiction.</P><P>âI think itâs very interesting,â he told Postmedia News. âItâs building on the use of an old plant in Chinese medicine and they seem to have been able to isolate what seems to be the active ingredient.â</P><P>However, Le Foll does not recommend people start taking hovenia to treat their hangovers just yet.</P><P>âMore experiments need to be done. We need to validate this in human subjects,â he said. âBut what is clear from this experiment is that . . . some drugs appear to accelerate the elimination of alcohol from the body, and also it seems to reduce the desire to drink alcohol.â</P><P><I>tfletcher@postmedia.com</I></P><DIV class="copyright">Â© Copyright (c) Postmedia News</DIV></DIV><DIV class="clear">Â </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
