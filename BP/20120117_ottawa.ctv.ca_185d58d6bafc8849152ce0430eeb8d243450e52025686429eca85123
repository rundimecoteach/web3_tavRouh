                                        CTVNews.ca Staff</P><P>Gloomy readers, take heed. There may be a reason why you rolled out bed this morning with a proverbial black cloud looming overhead. </P><P>It's Blue Monday, an ill-reputed date that has been dubbed &quot;the most depressing day of the year.&quot; </P><P>The theory stretches back to 2005 when psychologist Cliff Arnall was asked to figure out the most miserable day of the year. </P><P>Using an elaborate math formula, he came up with the third Monday in January – as if Mondays weren't demonized enough already. </P><P>Arnall reasoned that Blue Monday is the day when a slew of unpleasant variables such as drab weather, failing New Year's resolutions and Christmas bills collide, creating a veritable maelstrom of negativity. </P><P>&quot;Motivational levels also tend to be quite low at this time of year,&quot; Arnall told CTV's Canada AM last Blue Monday. </P><P>&quot;You've got something called the 'hibernation effect,' when people tend to be more lethargic, they eat more than they really need.&quot;</P><P>There are some questions, however, about whether Arnall's theory is actually valid. </P><P>Arnall was asked to whip up his formula for a public relations firm as part of a marketing campaign for travel company, Sky Travel. What better reason to go on vacation than to lessen the effects of the &quot;most depressing day of the year?&quot;</P><P>Psychiatry lecturer Dean Burnett is one of many critics who have dismissed Arnall's equation as ludicrous. In particular, he takes issue with the theory's liberal use of the word &quot;depressing.&quot;</P><P>&quot;True clinical depression (as opposed to a post-Christmas slump) is a far more complex condition that is affected by many factors, chronic and temporary, internal and external,&quot; he wrote in an editorial for the <I>Guardian</I>.</P><P>Even Arnall, the harbinger of doom himself, has conceded that his theory is not particularly helpful. </P><P>While he still stands behind his Blue Monday formula, Arnall told London's <I>Telegraph </I>newspaper two years ago that the date has become a &quot;self-fulfilling prophecy.&quot; </P><P>Instead of dwelling on the date, he urged people to focus on happiness year round. </P><P>&quot;I'm pleased about the impact it if it means people are talking about depression…but I'm also encouraging people to refute the whole notion of there being a most depressing day and to use the day as a springboard for the things that really matter in your life,&quot; he told the paper. </P><P>Still, many continue to latch onto the idea of Blue Monday. </P><P>This year, it didn't take long for the topic &quot;Blue Monday&quot; to trend on Twitter, landing only a few spots below #HappyMLKday -- a tag honouring Martin Luther King Jr., the famed civil rights activist who makes headlines on the third Monday of January for entirely different reasons. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
