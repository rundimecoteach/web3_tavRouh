One in four women have only ever had one sexual partner, compared with 17 per 
  cent of men, according to the Health Survey for England. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="secondPar"><P>
The results suggest Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who once claimed to have 
  slept with &quot;no more than 30 women&quot;, may have fared better than 
  three men with average romantic conquests. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="thirdPar"><P>
The data, published by the NHS Information Centre, showed 27 per cent of men 
  claimed the number of their partners had reached double figures while just 
  13 per cent of women said they had had 10 or more partners of the opposite 
  sex. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="fourthPar"><P>
The report also showed a continuing trend of a growing number of girls first 
  having sex under the age of 16 
</P></DIV><DIV class="fifthPar"><P>
More than one in four women aged 16 to 24 first had sex under the age of 
  consent compared with more than one in five men.
