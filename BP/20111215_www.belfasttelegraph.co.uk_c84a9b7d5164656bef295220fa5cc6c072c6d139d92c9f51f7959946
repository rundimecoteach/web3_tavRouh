            Commissioning this review of health and social care is the most important act of my time as Health Minister to date. Following through with it will be my priority for the rest of my tenure.<P>
Our health service is vital to everyone in Northern Ireland. We in the 
  Executive and in the Assembly, as leaders, are duty-bound to protect and 
  enhance this service.
</P><P>
My primary aim is to drive up the quality of care. Putting the patient first 
  is the driving force behind Transforming Care - The Review of Health and 
  Social Care.
</P><P>
My priorities are clear:
</P><UL><LI> improve and protect health and reduce inequalities through prevention;</LI></UL><UL><LI> improve the quality of services and outcomes for patients, clients and carers;</LI></UL><UL><LI>develop more innovative, accessible and responsive services, promoting choice and 
      making more services available in the community;</LI></UL><UL><LI>involve individuals, communities and the independent sector in the design, delivery 
      and evaluation of services;</LI></UL><UL><LI> improve productivity by ensuring effective and efficient allocation and utilisation 
      of available resources; and</LI></UL><UL><LI> ensure that we look after the most vulnerable in our society and the children, 
      the future for this country.</LI></UL><P>
To meet this challenge we must stop doing what does not work, challenge 
  out-of-date practices and acknowledge that some services are no longer fit 
  for purpose.
</P><P>
There is no &quot;do-nothing&quot; option. To continue as we are would leave 
  us with an unsustainable service, with consequences for patient care and 
  safety.
</P><P>
This is why I commissioned this review. I asked for a blueprint for reform.
</P><P>
I laid down a challenge to the review team: to examine the future provision of 
  services, including our acute hospital configuration, the development of 
  primary healthcare services and social care and the interface between 
  sectors to meet our priorities.
</P><P>
This review is not about cost-cutting. It is about quality, accessibility and 
  safety of patient care. As the financial situation tightens, there needs to 
  be a radical shift in where and how that money is used.
</P><P>
I am not naive. I have always known that the review would make recommendations 
  that will be challenging and I will not shirk hard decisions.
</P><P>
However, commissioning this review was not a difficult decision. Indeed, it 
  would have been irresponsible of me not to do so in light of the issues 
  facing us.
</P><P>
The proposals in this report represent radical change, which will provide a 
  more citizen-focused and effective health service.
</P><P>
The evidence - collected through engagement with more than 3,000 people - 
  speaks for itself. Our people feel that improvements are necessary.
</P><P>
The review proposes a model which places the individual at its centre. Health 
  and social care services will be increasingly accessible in local areas.
</P><P>
Patients will deal with fewer professionals and will be at the centre of 
  decision-making about their treatment. There will be a significant shift 
  from provision of services in hospitals to provision of services in the GP 
  surgery, closer to home, where it is safe and effective to do this.
</P><P>
Services will regard home as the hub and ensure that people can be cared for 
  at home, including at the end of life. Where specialist hospital care is 
  required it will be available - with patients being discharged into the care 
  of local services as soon as their health and care-needs permit.
</P><P>
The review proposes hospitals will work as a system, with each facility 
  contributing to the provision of a total service to its population. This 
  will mean change in all sites over a five-year period. A key aspect of this 
  approach is that critical clinical staff will be employed to work in a 
  hospital system and will be a resource for each population working as 
  necessary across hospital services and facilities.
</P><P>
The review envisages change at several of the current acute hospital sites - 
  it suggests a likely position, over time, of five to seven major acute 
  hospital networks in Northern Ireland.
</P><P>
However, the key test for any future service configuration has to be 
  sustainability and resilience in clinical terms. 
</P><P>
It will be on that basis that we are able to determine whether an acute 
  hospital is viable.
</P><P>
I recognise fully the need for greater productivity from the resources 
  available to us, particularly in these times of austerity, and it is in that 
  context that I firmly believe that the greater involvement of frontline 
  professionals in decision-making and service development is essential. Local 
  commissioning, too, has a crucial and powerful role to play in driving 
  change and innovation. 
</P><P>
The five commissioning groups, working with the trusts and local communities, 
  will now have a key role in developing plans by June for their areas to meet 
  the parameters laid down by the review team. And I want to see a shift in 
  care currently being carried out in hospitals into the community, with 
  patients being treated in the right place, at the right time, by the right 
  people.
</P><P>
From today, the challenge is take forward the implementation of this review. 
  We have been given a path, but we will need leadership to follow. I am 
  prepared to do just that. The recommendations of this report affect us all, 
  so I ask you to read it carefully at: 
  www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/hscreview131211.htm. 
</P><P>
In doing so, you will better understand the challenge facing us and the 
  solutions we believe will improve healthcare for us all.
