It is also proving very cost-effective in comparison with other traditional methods, with the added benefit of providing auditable training records.</P><P>In addition, the ability to do the training 'at a time and in a place' that is convenient to the trainee enables them to provide training for staff members unable to attend pre-arranged training sessions. They are planning on incorporating further modules into next year's training plan. </P><P>Use of the Blue Stream Learning GP Practice eLearning suite could not be simpler, registration is free and there are no annual subscription fees. The cost is based on a completed training module (there is a bookmark facility to allow a trainee to leave and return to the training module if required). Purchased training courses do not expire and there is no minimum commitment.</P><P>The suite resides on a secure server and can be accessed by a unique PIN code, which is practice specific. Each trainee registers on the system and is then presented with a menu of CQC outcomes. When each outcome is selected the trainee is able to choose from a drop-down list of compliance-related topics.</P><P>The trainee can access the Management Information System (MIS) to view/print their training record and the practice manager/training manager can access all records for their practice for statistical/audit purposes.</P><P>There has never been a greater need for a consistent comprehensive training tool within the GP practice environment and Blue Stream Learning Limited has: <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">The right products at the right time and at the right cost.</SPAN>Call us for more information on our freephone number 0800 1588661.</P><SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Blue Stream Learning Limited</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
