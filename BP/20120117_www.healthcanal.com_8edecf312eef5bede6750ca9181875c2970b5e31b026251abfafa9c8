Professor of Medicine (Assistant Dean) and Chair of the NorthWest  Academic Centre, Western Section, the University of Melbourne and study  author, Professor Peter Ebeling said the findings showed strategies were  now needed to improve Vitamin D awareness.</P><P>Vitamin D is necessary for optimal health as it helps prevent falls  in the elderly and, together with calcium, prevents fractures due to  osteoporosis, including hip fractures. Earlier work from this group has  also shown that low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased  risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</P><P>The overall prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (&lt;50 nmol/L) was  31% with women being more commonly affected (39% vs 23% in men,  overall). When evaluated by season and latitude, 42% of women and 27% of  men in southern Australia during summer/autumn had deficient levels,  which increased to 58% and 35% in women and men, respectively, during  winter/spring. This indicates that late winter and early spring are the  best times to measure vitamin D levels in the blood to detect  deficiency.</P><P>Those at greatest risk for vitamin D deficiency included women, the  elderly, obese, those not meeting the current physical activity  guidelines of more than two and a half hours a week, and those of  non-European descent.</P><P>Importantly, vitamin D deficiency was more common in older and  elderly women, the ones most at risk of fractures and falls, both of  which are associated with vitamin D deficiency.</P><P>“Vitamin D deficiency is recognised as a global public health problem  but the population-based prevalence of deficiency and its reach in  Australia has never previously been properly examined,” said Professor  Ebeling.</P><P>“The high prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency in our study may also be  associated with increasing prevalence of obesity in Australia. Like  many developed countries, Australia has experienced an increase in the  prevalence of overweight and obesity over the past 20 years. This is  likely to be caused by both decreased sun exposure from limited mobility  and/or reduced outdoor physical activity.”</P><P>Professor Ebeling and his co-authors from the University of Melbourne  and Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute said it was timely and  appropriate to develop national strategies and an awareness campaign for  balancing safe sun exposure and adequate vitamin D intake.</P><DIV class="field-label">More information: </DIV><P>Annie Rahilly, Media Officer, University of MelbourneP: 9035 5380</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
