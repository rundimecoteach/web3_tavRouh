them and provide us with the ability to detect displacement. By forming a
barrier and providing detection, these hairs prolong search time and 
make detection more likely because the bug has to spend more time 
clambering over them.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">'The 
results have implications for understanding why we look the way we do, 
what selective forces might have driven us to look the way we do, and 
may even provide insight for better understanding of how to reduce 
biting insects’ impact on  humans.'</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">The findings may explain why humans have retained a body-covering of fine hair.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">'Our
proposal is that we retain the fine covering because it aids detection 
and if we lost all hair, even the relatively invisible fine hair, our 
detection ability goes right down,' said Prof Siva-Jothy.</FONT></P><DIV class="thinCenter"><P class="imageCaption">At arms length: Bed bugs are deterred by hairy arms </P></DIV><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">The research is published today in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters. Prof Siva-Jothy said it would be wrong to assume women will always be bitten more often than hairier men.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">He pointed out: 'Men have more body hair than women which is caused by the action of testosterone at puberty. This does not necessarily mean that women are more likely to be bitten. </FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">'Blood-sucking insects are likely to have been selected to prefer to bite hosts in relatively hairless areas.”</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">The Sheffield scientists are investigating the biology, reproduction and immunity of blood-sucking insects.</FONT></P><P><FONT style="font-size: 1.2em;">Their aim is to find more effective ways of controlling parasitic insects and the diseases they spread.</FONT></P><DIV class="clear"> </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
