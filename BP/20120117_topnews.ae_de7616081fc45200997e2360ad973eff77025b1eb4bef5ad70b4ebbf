It claimed that the government is working on all aspects related to eradication of the disease from the region, and is completely mindful of the fact that there is still an urgent need for doing something out of the box in order to solve the matter and relieve people from their sufferings by curbing the dreadful influence of neurological conditions.</P><P>	While revealing his viewpoints regarding the issue, the Chairman of Neurological Alliance, Steve Ford, said that: “A crisis is looming but the government has its head in the sand”.</P></DIV><DIV class="links">»</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
