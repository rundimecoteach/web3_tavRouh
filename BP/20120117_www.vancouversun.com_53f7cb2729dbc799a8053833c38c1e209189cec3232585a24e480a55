Justine Hospital is claiming to be a world first, one of its surgeons has pioneered a new technique to repair a perforated eardrum that spares kids general anesthesia and hospitalization.</P><P>The 20-minute procedure can be done under local anesthesia and has been shown to achieve the same results as conventional surgery. The operation also saves about $1,500 in hospital costs.</P><P>&quot;Why should we hospitalize a child for something that can be done on an outpatient basis?&quot; asked Dr. Issam Saliba.</P><P>A five-year study demonstrated Saliba's technique successfully repaired perforated eardrums in 92.7 per cent of adults who had the procedure. For children, the success rate was 85.6 per cent. Hearing-test results were equally similar and positive.</P><P>A traditional myringoplasty involves grafting muscle tissue from behind or above the ear into the hole in the ear canal. Surgeons also can graft a piece of cartilage - the tragus - which sticks out from the inner ear. Children usually need to stay home from school for at least 10 days following the 90-minute operation.</P><P>Saliba's technique uses fatty tissue grafted from a five-millimetre incision at the back of the neck. Saliba inserts the fatty tissue into the eardrum and then places hyaluronic acid, onto the fatty tissue.</P><P>&quot;That's the magical solution,&quot; Saliba said, alluding to the unique properties of the acid.</P><DIV class="copyright">Â© Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun</DIV></DIV><DIV class="clear">Â </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
