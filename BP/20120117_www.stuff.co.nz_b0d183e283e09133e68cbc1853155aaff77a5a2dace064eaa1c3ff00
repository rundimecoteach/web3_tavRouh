    Researchers in Australia have found that a growing number of people are reporting caffeine toxicity from energy drinks, especially teenagers.
  </P><P>

    According to a study published inÂ <EM>The Medical Journal of Australia</EM>, nearly 300 calls were made to the New South Wales poisons centre regarding adverse reactions to energy drinks between January 2004 and the end of 2010, with more than a third of people attending hospital.
  </P><P>

    The authors say the report is a ''warning call'' for health authorities to better educate the public on the risks associated with high-energy drinks, and require beverages to display health warnings similar to those found on over-the-counter caffeine tablets.
  </P><P>

    For the study, Naren Gunja, a medical director and toxicologist at the NSW Poisons Information Centre, and Jared Brown, a senior poisons specialist, reviewed all the centre's calls relating to toxicity of high-energy drinks covering the seven-year period.
  </P><P>

    Calls regarding caffeinated energy drinks increased from 12 in 2004 to 65 in 2010, with recreational use the most common type of exposure.
  </P><P>

    Adverse reactions and toxicity from the beverages are primarily linked to caffeine.
  </P><P>

    Caffeine toxicity can mimic amphetamine poisoning, cause seizures, psychosis, cardiac arrhythmias and rarely even death, but the most common symptoms reported include irregular heart rate, tremors, stomach upsets and dizziness.
  </P><P>

    Teenagers were the most common age group affected, and energy drinks were often consumed with other stimulants, mainly alcohol.
  </P><P>

    Red Bull and V accounted for almost two-thirds of the energy drink-related cases referred to the centre, followed by Mother and Pulse.
