    People from the Nelson-Marlborough area heading off on holiday are encouraged to take the Healthline number with them – just in case.
  </P><P>

    Healthline – 0800611116 – is a telephone health advice line that can be called free from landlines and mobile phones.
  </P><P>

    It is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week by registered nurses who can advise about the best thing to do when holiday accidents or illnesses occur.
  </P><P>

    Depending on a person's symptoms, callers may be encouraged to seek medical treatment or be given advice on how they can manage a condition or minor injury. Occasionally, the nurse may refer you to be seen in the emergency department.
  </P><P>

    Healthline nurses can also direct you to the nearest GP clinic or after-hours pharmacy.
  </P><P>

    Healthline is funded by the Ministry of Health and provided under contract by Medibank Health Solutions.
  </P><P>

    Last quarter more than 3200 calls to Healthline were made from the Nelson-Marlborough area, about 3 per cent of the national total.
