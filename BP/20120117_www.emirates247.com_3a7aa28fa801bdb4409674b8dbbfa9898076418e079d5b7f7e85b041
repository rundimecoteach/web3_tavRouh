This almost made him  sick again.  
Alexis Rodriguez, 28, had visited Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Cente for  pneumonia threatmen.

Initially, Rodriguez thought the bill was legitimate. Last spring he had  received a large bill when he was hospitalized for pneumonia for three  weeks — but obviously not a large as this bill.</P><P>The error occurred because the company that prepares the bills had  mistakenly put the invoice number in the space where the invoice amount  should go.</P><P>The hospital representative said that an apology letter is being sent to everyone who received such bills. </P><P> </P><P><STRONG><SPAN style="color: #993300"><SPAN style="font-size: medium">Angry ex-husband bites off woman's lips</SPAN></SPAN></STRONG></P><P>INDIA: In a bizarre case, a divorced couple in the Indian city of Ahmedabad have hit the headlines.
