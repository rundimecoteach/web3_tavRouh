In order to protect our patients, and members of the public, we are closing hospital wards to all visitors (with some exceptions).</P><P>“Additionally we are asking the public only to come to A&amp;E if it is a real emergency, and if people do need to come to A&amp;E please don’t bring the whole family - just one person to accompany the patient.</P><P>“These measures are necessary to protect our patients and public from the highly contagious norovirus which causes projectile vomiting and uncontrollable diarrhoea.”</P><P>The ban on visitors is expected to last for 24-48 hours. </P><P>The spokesperson said if members of the public think they may have winter vomiting disease, they should not go to A&amp;E as there is no treatment for this virus, it needs to run its course over two or three days. </P><P>The best advice is stay indoors, isolate yourself from other people and drink lots of water to keep rehydrated. </P><P>For further advice call NHS Direct 0845 4647.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
