Nelson, MD, PhD, of the University of Glasgow Centre for Population and Health Sciences. “There is an economic incentive for transferring more embryos in the U.S., but no sound medical reason for doing so.”</P><P>New York <A href="http://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/default.htm" onclick="return sl(this,'','embd-lnk');">infertility</A> specialist Glenn L. Schattman, MD, disagrees.

Lawlor, PhD, of the University of Bristol, resulted in 33,514 live births.</P><P>The live birth rate was greater with the transfer of two embryos, compared to one, in women under the age of 40 and in women who were older. Transferring three embryos resulted in a lower birth rate than transferring two in the younger women and made no difference in outcomes in older women.</P><P>Compared to single-embryo transfer, transferring two or three embryos was associated with a higher risk for all adverse birth outcomes, including low birth weight and preterm delivery.</P><P>Not surprisingly, the overall live birth rate was lower in older women compared to younger ones, no matter how many embryos were transferred.</P><P>“A clear implication of our study is that [the] transfer of three embryos should no longer be supported in women of any age,” Nelson and Lawlor write.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="attribution_rdr"><DIV class="pagination_fmt"><DIV class="right_fmt"><DIV class="outline_fmt right"><A href="?page=2">Next Page <SPAN class="symbol_fmt">&gt;</SPAN></A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="rltd_newsletter_rdr"><DIV class="rltd_newsletter_top_fmt"><H3>trying to conceive newsletter</H3></DIV><DIV class="rltd_newsletter_middle_fmt"><DIV class="rltd_newsletter_body_fmt"><P>Support is so important when you're having trouble conceiving.
