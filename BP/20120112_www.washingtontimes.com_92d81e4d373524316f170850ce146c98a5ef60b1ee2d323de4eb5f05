Many Guatemalans, however, were left untreated.</P><P>Lawyers for the Guatemalan victims said the $1.8 million in aid for <A href="/topics/guatemala/">Guatemala</A> is a positive action.</P><P>But the <A href="/topics/department-of-justice/">Department of Justice</A> papers filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia on Jan. 9 are an “extremely disappointing” response, given the harms done by U.S. officials to these victims and their families, said <A href="/topics/terrence-collingsworth/">Terrence Collingsworth</A>, partner at Conrad &amp; Scherer.</P><P>“It’s almost as if there’s a blockade that protects the <A href="/topics/us-government/">government</A> with immunity, and when you stack the statutes together … it’s like it’s an impermeable wall,” said Conrad &amp; Scherer attorney <A href="/topics/piper-hendricks/">Piper Hendricks</A>.</P><P>But she said she is “seeing some chinks in that armor,” adding that she and her colleagues would be filing briefs by March 9 before U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton.</P><P>In the <A href="/topics/department-of-justice/">Justice Department</A> court filings, Tony West, assistant attorney general, and his co-counsel wrote, “As a result of these unethical studies, a terrible wrong has occurred.” But while the United States “is committed to taking appropriate steps to address that wrong,” they wrote, “this lawsuit is not the proper vehicle - and this Court is not the proper forum - through which the consequences of this shameful conduct may be resolved.”</P><P>The <A href="/topics/department-of-justice/">Justice Department</A> asked that current federal office-holders be dismissed from the case, and cited the Federal Tort Claims Act as a primary basis for immunity for the United States. Lawyers for Mirta Roses Periago, director of the Pan-American Health Organization, also asked the court to “dismiss this case with prejudice” because she and the organization “are indisputably immune from this action.”</P><P>The <A href="/topics/guatemala/">Guatemala</A> case was the subject of a September 2011 report, “Ethically Impossible: STD Research in <A href="/topics/guatemala/">Guatemala</A> From 1946 to 1948,” conducted by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. The case has been described as Tuskegee-style because of its similarities to the infamous Alabama experiments in which black men with syphilis saw doctors but were never told about their syphilis or given treatment for it.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
