regulation of the cosmetic surgery industry was needed after a
health scare over breast implants made by a now defunct French
company.</P><P>Health Secretary Andrew Lansley also ordered a review into the
safety and quality of private clinics offering cosmetic surgery in
Britain.</P><P>The government has been under pressure to act after an uproar in
Britain over breast implants made by Poly Implant Prothese (PIP),
which went bankrupt in 2010.</P><P>&quot;I have set out today a number of actions to ensure we learn the
lessons and look at how we can tighten up regulation of the wider
cosmetic industry so that this doesn't happen again,&quot; Lansley said
in a statement.</P><P>The French government has advised 30,000 women in France who
bought implants from PIP to have them removed after concerns since
the death from cancer of a French woman carrying PIP implants.</P><P>The British government says there is no need for the routine
removal of PIP breast implants but says concerned women given the
implants through the state-funded National Health Service (NHS)
could have them removed and replaced at NHS expense.</P><P>Lansley told parliament health minister Frederick Howe he would
carry out a rapid study of the use of PIP breast implants in
Britain to draw lessons for future regulation.</P><P>He said he had asked Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, to
look into health safeguards for people seeking cosmetic surgery
such as breast implants and wrinkle-smoothing treatments.</P><DIV class="ad_300_250"><DIV class="advertisementPanel"><DIV class="title">Advertisement</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Keogh's review will look at whether there needs to be better
regulation of cosmetic products and surgery in Britain and Europe
and whether patients &quot;can be confident that the people who carry
out procedures have the skills to do so&quot;, Lansley said.</P><P>The review will also look at record keeping, Lansley said,
saying the implant affair had shown safety information the industry
collected was of variable quality. &quot;Without good data, we have no
way of knowing when problems arise,&quot; he said.</P><P>About 300,000 PIP implants were sold worldwide before the firm
went out of business after an official probe revealed it was using
a cheaper unapproved industrial-grade silicone in some
products.</P><P>A British review found no link between the implants and cancer,
but had not been able to establish if the PIP implants were more
likely to rupture than others, saying information from the industry
to the regulator was patchy.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
