–<SPAN class="hn-date">2 days ago</SPAN> </P><P>PARIS — An appetite-curbing hormone found in the gut may help overweight and obese people shed weight, lower blood pressure and reduce cholesterol levels, according to a study released Wednesday.</P><P>Known as glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, the hormone is naturally secreted from the intestine when we eat.</P><P>Recently, doctors have begun to use GLP-1 to treat patients with type 2 diabetes due to the molecule's ability to regulate sugar levels in the blood.</P><P>But they also noticed that the hormone appeared to make patients less hungry, raising the question of whether it could work as a treatment for obesity.</P><P>A team of researchers led by Tina Vilsboll of the University of Copenhagen designed a study to find out.</P><P>Reviewing medical literature, they analysed the results of 25 clinical trials involving over 6,000 patients who had been given GLP-1.</P><P>Patients with and without diabetes who received a minimum dosage for at least 20 weeks showed greater weight loss than control groups, they reported in the British Medical Journal (BMJ).</P><P>There was also improvement in blood pressure, cholesterol and glycaemic control, the process by which the body adjusts the impact of carbohydrates on blood sugar levels.</P><P>The findings provide &quot;convincing evidence&quot; that GLP-1 &quot;results in clinically relevant beneficial effects on body weight&quot; for obese patients, the researchers concluded.</P><P>&quot;Additional beneficial effects on blood pressure and total cholesterol might also be achieved.&quot;</P><P>The treatment had side-effects in some patients, including vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea. But this did not seems to effect the number of people dropping out of the trials, suggesting that, overall, GLP-1 was well tolerated, they said.</P><P>Vilsboll and colleagues recommended that the hormone be &quot;considered&quot; for obese patients suffering from diabetes, and called for further trials to test its efficacy for obese people who are not diabetic.</P><P>In a commentary, also in the BMJ, Raj Padwal from the University of Alberta argued that -- despite its weight-reducing powers -- GLP-1 should not alter current medical practice.</P><P>&quot;Modification of diet and lifestyle remain the cornerstone of the treatment of type 2 diabetes,&quot; he said.</P><P>The hormone's longterm safety is still unknown, he added.</P><P id="hn-distributor-copyright"><SPAN>Copyright ©  2012   AFP.
