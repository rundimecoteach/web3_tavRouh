'While they might happily overlook a few common flaws, there are certain behaviours that men just won't get away with.'The poll found that <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">women</SPAN> look for a good personality, a <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">sense of humour</SPAN> and good looks, while <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">dodgy dancing, </SPAN>leaving clothes lying around on the bedroom floor and snoring are sure signs of <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">imperfection</SPAN>.One in five women would forgive leaving the toilet seat up and a lack of culinary skills but men using their girlfriend's toothbrush and not <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">listening</SPAN> were sure fire ways to lose 'perfect' points.'The average guy may not be able to compete with the image of <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">David Beckham</SPAN>, but there are still a number of small <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">changes</SPAN> they can do to make a big difference,' says Miss McReynolds.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
