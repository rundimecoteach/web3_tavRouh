                                        Two biotechnology firms said Tuesday that they would soon offer machines capable of sequencing a human genome in about a day, at a cost of less than $1,000. <A href="http://www.illumina.com/" target="_blank">Illumina Inc.</A> and <A href="http://www.lifetechnologies.com/us/en/home.html" target="_blank">Life Technologies Corp.</A> both announced that their new sequencers would come to market in the second half of this year.
Researchers have been waiting for the cost of sequencing a genome, an individual's entire DNA blueprint, to fall to $1,000 for some time. The conventional wisdom has been that once the price drops to that point, it might become affordable for doctors to deliver &quot;personalized medicine&quot; -- to study patients' genomes to make diagnoses and perfect medical care.   
										
                                        
                                        
                                        Cheaper access to genomes would also help researchers who are trying to figure out what <A class="taxInlineTagLink" id="HHA000024" title="Genes and Chromosomes" href="/topic/health/human-body/genes-chromosomes-HHA000024.topic">genes</A> cause particular traits, and why. One indication that achieving the $1,000 price tag would be a milestone: The Archon <A href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/28/science/la-sci-venter-q-a-20111029" target="_blank">Genomics X Prize</A> will challenge teams to sequence 100 full genomes for less than $1,000 apiece during a one-month period next year.
&quot;The speed of sequencing and the affordability are really getting into the medical sphere now,&quot; said Dr. Eric Topol, chief academic officer of Scripps Health in La Jolla, Calif. Until recently, he said, sequencing a genome &quot;took a week -- now it can be done in hours.  And it took $4,000 to send [the test] out; now this will get it down to $1,000. That's a big jump.&quot;
Topol said the rapid sequencing technologies would at first be most likely to affect researchers and physicians treating <A class="taxInlineTagLink" id="HEDAI0000010" title="Cancer" href="/topic/health/diseases-illnesses/cancer-HEDAI0000010.topic">cancers</A> -- who will now be able to sequence tumors to determine the best therapy for a patient far less expensively.  
&quot;This opens up all kinds of opportunities in genomic medicine,&quot; Topol said. But he cautioned that it would be quite some time before whole genome sequencing would be a matter of course for everyone. 
People are still uncomfortable contemplating their own genes, he added -- and many doctors remain uncomfortable with genetic information, too.
