Batches of a saline nasal spray sold as Sterimar Isotonic (100ml) in High Street chemists have been recalled amid safety concerns.

The health watchdog the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has received warning of possible bacterial contamination.

The affected batches are FE1248b and FE1249. The number is printed on packaging and the base of the can.

Experts insist there is no immediate health threat.

The two bacteria identified - Pseudomonas stutzeri and Sphingomonas paucimobilis - are commonly found in soil, water and hospital environments and human infections are rare.

The bacteria should not affect healthy people. However, those who suffer from existing sinus or nasal problems, have recently undergone surgery or have a weakened immune system may be at risk.

The possible symptoms exhibited can be nasal or facial tenderness, discoloured mucus or a fever.

Consumers are asked that if they have any of the affected batches, to stop using the product immediately and return it to the retailer. If they exhibit any of the symptoms listed above then they should consult a healthcare professional.
