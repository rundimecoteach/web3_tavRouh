CINCINNATI - We all know exercise contributes to better health and well-being.  It makes us feel better!

And now researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School have discovered an 'exercise hormone,"called irisin.

They say this hormone is produced in response to exercise, and that it may be turning people's white fat brown, a process which they say will lessen susceptibility to obesity, diabetes, and other health problems.

Brown vs. white?  Scientists say brown fat is more useful  It actually burns calories.  White fat just sits there.

Researchers studied mouse and human muscle cells. They suspected that muscle cells communicate biochemically with body fat, leading to health benefits.

Much study remains to be done, but researchers are excited about what irisin could do for people who might not be able to exercise.
