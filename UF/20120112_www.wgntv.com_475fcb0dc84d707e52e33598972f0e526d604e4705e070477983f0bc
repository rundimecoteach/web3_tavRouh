Walgreen's on Tuesday is slated to open a two-story flagship store on State Street in the Loop that will offer more than aspirin and batteries.

The store at State and Randolph will offer manicures and eyebrow shaping, made-to-order sushi, a juice and smoothie bar, self-serve frozen yogurt and even a humidor. The new Walgreen's will also offer a clinic and an upscale cosmetics department. It will also sell wine, alcohol and fresh food.

The store is marking its return to the State and Randolph intersection where it had run a store from 1926 until 2005.

The grand opening ceremony will be today from 4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
