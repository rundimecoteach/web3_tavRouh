A SIMPLE once-a-day fat-busting jab could be the key to battling ­Britain’s obesity crisis.

In trials of the drug, patients have lost at least half a stone (7lb). One apparently shed up to four stone after taking the treatment.

Injections of the hormone can also cut blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

One obesity expert hailed the ground-breaking findings as ­“potentially revolutionary”.

Doctors already use it to treat diabetics. The hormone, called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), is secreted from the intestine when we eat and is the body’s natural way of ­suppressing appetite.

People taking it feel less hungry and it is already used in Britain to treat type 2 diabetes because of its ability to regulate blood sugar levels.

Dr David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said: “These new injections really have the potential for revolutionising treatment. Safety-wise they are pretty good. I am using them on my patients and have had a lot of ­success. For some they have been dramatically successful, with one losing about four stone and having blood sugar under control for the first time ever.”

Researchers at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark analysed the results of 25 trials involving more than 6,000 patients to assess the effect of GLP-1 on weight loss, blood pressure, cholesterol and liver enzyme levels, as well as blood sugar control.

They found that patients given a daily dose for at least 20 weeks achieved weight loss of half a stone.

However, common side-effects included nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. But researchers say it did not appear to affect the numbers dropping out of the trials, suggesting that overall patient ­satisfaction with the treatment is relatively high.

Professor Tina Vilsboll, who led the research published in the ­British Medical Journal, said: “Our analysis provides convincing ­evidence that GLP-1 chemicals, when given to obese patients with or without diabetes, result in ­clinically relevant beneficial effects on body weight.

“Additional beneficial effects on blood pressure and total cholesterol might also be achieved.”                      The researchers believe that the treatment “should be considered in patients with diabetes who are obese or overweight”.                     Professor Raj Padwal, of the ­University of Alberta, in an accompanying BMJ editorial, said: ­“Modification of diet and lifestyle remains the cornerstone of the treatment of type 2 diabetes.”
