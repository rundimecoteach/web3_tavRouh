Experts at the British Museum in London are examining a silver Viking hoard that was found buried underground and could shed new light on a murky period of history.

The hoard, which includes more than 200 coins and pieces of jewellery, was found in September by Darren Webster using a metal detector on land around Silverdale in north Lancashire.

It includes a coin that is thought to refer to a previously unknown Viking ruler in northern England and also coins from the time of Alfred the Great - who reigned 871/99 - and from the Viking kingdom of Northumbria.

The hoard was placed in a lead box and buried underground at a time when the Anglo-Saxons were attempting to wrest control of the north of the country from the Vikings.

Staff at the museum, in Bloomsbury, central London, were called in after the hoard was reported as potential treasure.

A coroner will decide later this week whether it qualifies as treasure. If it does, an independent committee will value it and any money raised will be divided equally between Mr Webster and the landowner.

The hoard was on show on Wednesday at an event in the museum to mark the launch of the Treasure and Portable Antiquities Scheme reports, which show there were 157,188 finds recorded in 2009 and 2010.

Ed Vaizey, Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, said: "It is widely recognised that both the Portable Antiquities Scheme and the Treasure Act 1996 have been a great success.

"They are both helping to enrich museum collections, with the most important archaeological discoveries being acquired for the nation.

"It is a tremendous achievement that the Staffordshire and Frome hoards are now on display in public collections where they can be enjoyed by all."
