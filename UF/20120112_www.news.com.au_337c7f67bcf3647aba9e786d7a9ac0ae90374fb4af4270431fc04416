The musician says Love is the Cure: Ending the Global AIDS  Epidemic will include memories of friends who died of AIDS-related  illnesses, including Queen frontman Freddie Mercury.

British publisher Hodder & Stoughton says the book will be  published in July along with an audio book read by the British pop  star.

Proceeds will go to the Elton John AIDS Foundation.

John said on Monday the book would ask why more was not being  done to cure the disease.

He said AIDS "is a disease that must be cured not by a  miraculous vaccine, but by changing hearts and minds, and through a  collective effort to break down social barriers".
