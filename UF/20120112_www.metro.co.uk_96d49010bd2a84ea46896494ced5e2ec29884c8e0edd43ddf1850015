The Harley Medical Group said the cost of replacing the implants would force it out of business.

The group, which performed more implants than any other private group, did not have the necessary resources, surgeons or operating facilities, said group chairman Mel Braham.

It would supply the NHS with replacement implants if that was the patient’s decision, he added.

But the government should accept ‘moral responsibility’ for replacements after the implants were approved despite containing non-medical grade silicone used in mattresses.

‘We’re an innocent victim like everyone else, we’re attempting to do our best for our patients,’ Mr Braham added.

About 40,000 British women received PIP implants. They include Essex lap dancer Rebecca Bowler, 25, who faces three months off work if she has her £4,200 implants removed.

Eight private companies and the NHS are offering free replacements. Health secretary Andrew Landsley told the Commons it was not ‘fair to the taxpayer for the NHS to foot the bill for patients who had their operation privately’.

British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons president Fazel Fatah said it was ‘outrageous’ some clinics were refusing their duty of care after profiting from cheap products.
