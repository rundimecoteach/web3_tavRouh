Ladies searching for Mr Right, look away now. The ‘perfect man’, it seems, does not exist.

While many chaps have positive attributes, the majority are deeply flawed.

In fact, in a study of 2,000 women, most ranked their partner as only 69 per cent perfect.

Included in a list of 20 common shortfalls are failing to make an effort with their partner’s friends, criticising their driving and the inability to multi-task.

Other male failings include leaving the toilet door open, watching too much sport and poor personal grooming.

Nikki McReynolds, marketing director for Remington, which commissioned the study, said: ‘It seems women are quite realistic on what they look for from their partner.

‘While they might happily overlook a few common flaws, there are certain behaviours that men just won’t get away with.’

The research found a third of women

will turn a blind eye to their man watching too much sport – as long as

they listen to them when it counts.

But one in five women is convinced

her mischievous partner only pretends to listen to them, while others

believe it’s ‘in one ear and out the other’.

Thankfully, one in five

would forgive leaving the toilet seat up, while the leniency also

stretches to those who don’t help with the cooking.

A quarter of women said dodgy dancing

was forgivable, but bugbears such as clothes being left on the bedroom

floor and snoring can count against men.

And guys beware: Leaving the toilet

dirty, not making an effort with their partner’s family and using her

toothbrush are definitely big no-nos.

Leaving out nail clippings, growing a

scruffy beard or being too much of a mummy’s boy are other sure fire

ways to guarantee ‘imperfection’.

Female bosses are better! Women more tolerant of staff checking Facebook or doing personal chores in office hours

When asked what would make the perfect man, a good personality came top, followed by a sense of humour and looks.

Miss McReynolds said: ‘The average guy

may not be able to compete with the image of a David Beckham, but there

are still a number of small changes they can do to make a big

difference.’
