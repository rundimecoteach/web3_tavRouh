The assets of a New Zealander accused defrauding Queensland Health of $11 million have been seized by the Public Trustee.

The seizure happened on Tuesday but the details have just been made public today.

Lawyers from the Queensland Government want to restrain the assets - including designer clothes, furniture and framed photos - under suspicion they were purchased by Hohepa Morehu-Barlow.

The assets were found at the home of the accused's sister, Kelly-Ann Barlow.
