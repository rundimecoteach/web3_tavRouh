Forever Youth Liberator from Yves Saint Laurent had already racked up more  than 5,000 pre-orders.

In a trial of 50 women, nine out of ten said their skin looked more luminous  after using the lotion, while 72 per cent said fine lines were less visible.

The range contains synthetic versions of glycans, naturally occurring sugars  in the skin.

Science writer and broadcaster Vivienne Parry says: "Glycobiology is going to  change the world in many areas and it is a very important development in  skincare too.

"Glycans are complicated sugars that play a key role in the structure of the  skin.

"They also sit on the surface of cells and transmit messages to them. Glycans  reduce with age. These glycans can make skin cells act as they would have  when in a younger body."

A study of the technique in the journal Technology Review in 2003 said the  discovery was "one of the ten emerging technologies that would change the  world."

YSL worked with Professor Peter Seeberger, of Germany's Max Planck Institute,  to develop the serum.

He said: "I was surprised YSL was interested in my work. I'm interested in  health, not face paint. Still, we were able to apply our existing techniques  to glycans in skin."

But the search for eternal youth is not cheap. Just 30g — just more than two  tablespoons of the serum — is Ј50.

Skincare wonder products are not new — and often cheaper.

Recent examples include Boots' No7 Protect & Perfect Beauty Serum,  which enjoyed a sales boost after being featured in a 2007 BBC documentary.

And in April 2008 there was a stampede to supermarket shelves as Waitrose's  Baby Bottom Butter sold like hot cakes after parents recommended using the  Ј2.54 cream on their faces too.

Another cheap skin product which took the beauty world by surprise was  supermarket Aldi's Ј3.49 Lacura Multi-Intensive Serum.

The Sun checked out what 30g of other luxury goods would cost you: 30g of  sterling silver costs Ј17.34, 28g of Mottra Sterlet Sturgeon Caviar is Ј55  from online supermarket Ocado and 30g of Fresh Black Winter Truffle is  Ј63.95 from London Fine Foods Group.
