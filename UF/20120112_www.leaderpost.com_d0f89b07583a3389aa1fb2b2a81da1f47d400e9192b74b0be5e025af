An investigation into the April 2008 crash of a training jet near Moose Jaw has concluded a cracked turbine blade in its engine brought down the jet.

Two airmen successfully bailed out of the Britishbuilt CT-156 Hawk jet, but were seriously injured.

At the time, they were identified as Lt. Rock Veilleux of the Canadian Forces and Maj. Frank Wegener of the German Air Force, who was flying the aircraft.

A report released Wednesday by the air force's Directorate of Flight Safety said they noticed a change in the engine sound, then a warning light.

Declaring an emergency, they prepared for a forced landing, but had to eject a mile short of the runway. The aircraft was destroyed in the resulting crash inside the base's perimeter.

The investigation indicated fatigue caused a low-pressure turbine blade to crack, then fail. The engine vibrated so badly that it seized.

An investigation to determine the cause of the fatigue is ongoing, the report said.

A report into a 2001 Hawk crash at Cold Lake also noted a missing low-pressure turbine blade from the engine, "which is similar to LPT blade failures in four previous CF Hawk aircraft occurrences."
