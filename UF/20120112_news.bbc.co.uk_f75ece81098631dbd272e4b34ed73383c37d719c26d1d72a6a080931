The Harley Medical Group should replace PIP silicone breast implants free of charge, Health Minister Earl Howe has said.

Earl Howe said private companies had a "moral" and "legal" duty to address the matter on behalf of their patients, adding that eight firms had already agreed to replace the implants for free.

He told peers on 12 January 2012 that the government was urging the Harley Medical Group, which fitted more PIP breast implants than any other UK cosmetic surgery firm, to "follow suit".

Breast implants from French firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) were banned last year after they were found to contain a non-medical-grade silicone filler.

The Harley Medical Group said replacing the banned implants would put it out of business.

Liberal Democrat Baroness Hussein-Ece expressed "dismay and concern" at the firm's decision as peers debated the matter during their daily half-hour question session.

She asked the government to consider taking action against "unscrupulous" private firms refusing to replace the implants free of charge.

The government has said patients who had their surgery on the NHS would be able to have the implants removed and replaced free of charge.

The NHS will also pay to remove, but not replace, implants if a private clinic refuses or no longer exists.

A review has also been set up into the regulation and governance of the cosmetic surgery sector.

But Earl Howe cautioned how effective regulation could be where there is a "deliberate effort" to conceal facts from inspectors.

Independent crossbench peer Baroness Morgan of Drefelin said the PIP breast implants scare was causing "huge" concern for women with breast cancer.

She told peers that women diagnosed with breast cancer, treated privately and refused help from a private practitioner could only have their implants removed by the NHS, not replaced or reconstructed.

"I don't think that's right and I hope you will be able to reconsider that," she told Earl Howe.
