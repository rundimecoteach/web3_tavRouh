NEW YORK: One New York resident had his heart in his mouth when he  received his hospital bill whopping $44.8 million. This almost made him  sick again.

Alexis Rodriguez, 28, had visited Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Cente for  pneumonia threatmen. He took the service of outpatient and the bill  should have amounted to no more than $300.

Rodriguez is one of the several hundred patients getting billed for  tens of millions of dollars because of a computer error at the New York  City hospital.

Initially, Rodriguez thought the bill was legitimate. Last spring he had  received a large bill when he was hospitalized for pneumonia for three  weeks — but obviously not a large as this bill.

The error occurred because the company that prepares the bills had  mistakenly put the invoice number in the space where the invoice amount  should go.

The hospital representative said that an apology letter is being sent to everyone who received such bills.

The boy was scared of taking the test as he was ill prepared for it and he had received a scolding from his father for poor performance at school.

ATLANTA: Officials say a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Costa Rica was diverted to Tampa, Florida, on Sunday evening after a couple from Germany became unruly.

Delta spokeswoman Chris Kelly Singley said Flight 414 departed Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport at 6 pm on Sunday and landed at Tampa International Airport at 7:34 pm. The captain made the call to land, the spokeswoman said. After the "unruly" passengers were removed, the plane went on to Costa Rica, she said.

Tampa International Airport spokeswoman Janet Zink identified the passengers as Peter and Gabriele Strohmaier of Dusseldorf, Germany. She said they were seated in first class and demanding food and champagne and refused to sit down.

Zink said no charges had been filled. The FBI and Transportation Security Administration were investigating.

Reached at the Tampa hotel where the couple was spending Sunday night, Gabriele Strohmaier said that a Delta crew member "exaggerated enormously and felt terribly insulted" after her husband raised concerns about the food and beverage service.

She said her husband had asked for a glass of champagne, but was told it was all gone. She said the crew member then walked away rather than listen to his concerns. She denied that she or her husband was told to sit down and refused.

"No, we were not standing," she said.

Peter Strohmaier, who identified himself as a lawyer, said he "did nothing except to say I would like to have the meal and so on...all normal things."

He said the Delta crew member told him she was not pleased with his attitude.

"I am not prepared to accept such behavior," he said, adding that in the end he didn't get champagne, a meal or even water. The couple had flown to the US from Germany earlier in the day.

Gabriele Strohmaier said the couple need to "take another airline, naturally not Delta" to get to Costa Rica
