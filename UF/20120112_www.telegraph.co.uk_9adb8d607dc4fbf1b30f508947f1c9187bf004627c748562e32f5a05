The fast food chain will give out 9 million Mudpuddle Farm books, written by    Michael Morpurgo, over the next four weeks, after it signed a tie-up with    the publisher Harper Collins.

In 2011, sales of children’s books averaged 1.16 million per week – 6.4    million in a four week period – which means that McDonald’s will be handing    out considerably more children’s books than are usually sold in the UK in    the same period.

A finger puppet, relating to the series of books, will also be included    alongside the Happy Meal.

This is the latest attempt by McDonald's to improve its reputation, following    the decision to sell only organic milk, print calories on its menu boards,    and refurbish all of its outlets.

This is the latest attempt by McDonald's to improve its reputation, following    the decision to sell only organic milk, print calories on its menu boards,    and refurbish all of its outlets.

Its Happy Meals, which cost about £2.20, have come under fire in the past for    encouraging 'pester power'. Alongside a burger or chicken nuggets, chips and    a drink children are given a toy, usually tied in to the latest cinema    release.

McDonald's started to include bags of fruit after accusations that the Happy    Meals were unhealthy.

At the end of last year an American woman filed a lawsuit in California    alleging that McDonald's was luring in her daughter through its distribution    of free toys.

Literacy campaigners said it did not matter if McDonald's decision was    prompted by a desire to improve its image. Eight out of ten all families    with young children visit the fast-food company at least once over the    course of the year, so there was a strong chance they would end up with a    book.

Jonathan Douglas, director of The National Literacy Trust, said: “Our recent    research showed that one in three children in this country don’t own a book,    which is extremely concerning as there is a clear link between book    ownership and children's future success in life. We are very supportive of    McDonald’s decision to give families access to popular books, as its size    and scale will be a huge leap towards encouraging more families to read    together.”

The McDonald’s Happy Meal book promotion will include six titles from the    Mudpuddle Farm range: Mossop’s Last Chance; Albertine, Goose Queen; Pigs    Might Fly!; Jigger’s Day Off; Martians at Mudpuddle Farm; Mum’s the Word.
