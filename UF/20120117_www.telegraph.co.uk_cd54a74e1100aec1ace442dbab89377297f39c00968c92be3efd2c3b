For generations, scientists thought the human tongue could detect only four    basic tastes: sweet, sour, salt and bitter.

Then a fifth was discovered, "umami"    or savoury. Now, researchers have identified a previously-unrecognised "sixth    taste" â€“ fat.

A team in the United States has located a chemical receptor in the taste buds    on the tongue that recognises fat molecules, and found that its sensitivity    varies between individuals.

The finding may help to explain why some people consume more fatty foods, as    they are less aware of the taste as they eat.

The researchers hope their discovery can be exploited to combat obesity by    increasing people's sensitivity to fat in their food.

Apart from the basic tastes, other aspects of food flavour actually come from    the smell and are detected in the nose.

The research team, from the school of medicine at Washington University, St    Louis, showed that people with more of a receptor called CD36 were better at    detecting the presence of fat in food.

They found that variations in a gene that produces CD36 makes people more or    less sensitive to the presence of fat.

"The ultimate goal is to understand how our perception of fat in food    might influence what foods we eat and the qualities of fat that we consume,"    said Professor Nada Abumrad, who led the research.

"We've found one potential reason for individual variability in how    people sense fat. What we will need to determine in the future is whether    our ability to detect fat in foods influences our fat intake, which clearly    would have an impact on obesity."

The study, which is published in the Journal of Lipid Research, found that    those with half as much CD36 were eight times less sensitive to the presence    of fat.

Up to 20 per cent of people are believed to have a variant of the CD36 gene    that is associated with producing lower levels of the receptor, which could    mean they are less sensitive to the presence of fat in food. This may make    them more prone to obesity.

Dr Yanina Pepino, who also conducted the research, added: "If we follow    the results in animals, a high-fat diet would lead to less production of    CD36, and that, in turn, could make a person less sensitive to fat.

"From our results in this study, we would hypothesise that people with    obesity may make less of the CD36 protein.

"So it would seem logical that the amounts of the protein we make can be    modified, both by a person's genetics and by the diet they eat."
