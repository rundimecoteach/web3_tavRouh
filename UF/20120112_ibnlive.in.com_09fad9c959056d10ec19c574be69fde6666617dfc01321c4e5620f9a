THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: NIMS medicity has introduced wireless capsule endoscopy, a new diagnostic tool for the detection of small bowel disease non-invasively.

�This technique does not require insertion of endoscope through the mouth.

�Instead of lying down still on an examination table during the exam, patients can walk after the ingestion of the pill.

People while using wireless endoscopy can walk, sit and even return to normal work while the capsules are recording images.

�It is also disposable and therefore comfortable to patients.
