The central team has started analysis of the situation and is in touch with the health authorities of Maharashtra, Mumbai Municipal Corporation, while also involving experts from concerned stake-holders, including the Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai. 	Hinduja hospital is not accredited to diagnose XDR or TDR, the release said. "So far as the report from Hinduja Hospital is concerned, this Hospital Laboratory is not accredited by the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme, for culture and sensitivity for second line drugs to diagnose Extensively Drug-Resistant (XDR)/Totally Drug Resistant (TDR) cases and is only accredited for conducting Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST) by liquid culture and sensitivity for first line drug only," it said.
