Shopping for way to break cigs habit

HEALTH experts are meeting South Tyneside shoppers as part of a drive to get smokers to quit the habit.

NHS South of Tyne and Wear has organised a stop smoking roadshow to tour the region, which includes various dates in the borough. Staff will man stands, and will be able to refer people wishing to quit to their local stop smoking services at community pharmacies, on the spot. They can also give out information on stopping smoking and arrange to contact those people who go away with information to signpost them to services at a later date. Pam Lee, public health consultant for South Tyneside PCT, said: “Stopping smoking is the single greatest thing you can do to improve your health. “With the help of the NHS Stop Smoking Service, you are four times more likely to quit than using willpower alone.” The road show will be visiting Tesco in Newcastle Road, Simonside, South Shields, today, tomorrow, January 27 and 28, and February 2 to 4. It will also be at Asda in Coronation Street, South Shields, tomorrow and Saturday, as well as January 27 and 28 and February 17 and 18.
