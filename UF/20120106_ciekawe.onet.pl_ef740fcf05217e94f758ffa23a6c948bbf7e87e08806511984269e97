Oto komentarz czasopisma lekarskiego: In fact Dugas was wrongly identified as an initial source of infection. In reality he had been a patient in an epidemiological study in which he was identified by the letter ?O?. At some point ?O? became ?zero?. Further studies clearly demonstrated that he could not be singled out as having brought AIDS to the gay bath houses of San Francisco and Los Angeles, from where it was believed to have spread.
